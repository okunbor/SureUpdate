*********************************************
My heart has already found it's way to you. I want you and no one else. You mean everything to me. I think we should try and make this work. You have to know you're the one, and only one I want. Not only are you perfect for me, you're the perfect friend and I hope we can and will be more. I could never ask for better then what we have had. I am hoping you're feeling the same way because my heart is set on you, and only you, baby.
******************************************

You are like a dream I never thought would ever come true for me. When we started talking on here. My eyes shine with glee when I know you are intereted in me.You seems like a great man to me and kindhearted; I pray that we will finally know if we are meant to be with one another. I haven't ever talked to anyone so like you before. You make me feel special like never before. So far, the things that you are doing shows me that you are such a caring person who would love me forever till the end of time. I just want to be loved and have someone to love back the way I've always wanted. I want to find my best friend, my soul mate, my lover and my Prince Charming. I feel as if you may just be the one I am looking for and have been searching for all my life. These are the feelings I am having for you as of this moment.
***********************************************

I want to tell you that the love I have for you is undying. It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together. I want to lie next to you at night and fall asleep in your arms. I want to wake to your beautiful smile. I want to share in your joys and sorrows. I want to be your everything, because you are everything to me.I promise to always love you and always hold you in my heart. I will always be here for you when you need me, and I will love you no matter what life brings us. You are my soul mate, and I vow to love you all eternity. I love you, baby.
***********************************************

 You are a blessing that my entire being is very thankful for. I feel that we were made to love, listen, understand, and work through all times in our lives together and individually.I feel that we have shared more time together than we ever will and I know there are many more special occasions and moments in our lives that will surprise and bring us closer.You are my soul mate and nothing, and no one else feels more right than you!! I love you eternally and unconditionally. God's love has answered this prayer I've wanted and been almost too anxious for so long. I miss you more than words can say and my love will reach any distance and fly to be in your dreams and heart each evening that we can not be together. I physically long for you each night and will see you in my dreams until we find ourselves wrapped in the love that grows stronger and deeper each day, into our future together....... I believe and have faith in you.
****************************************************

I think the most important key to a successful relationship is when you truly enjoy each other's company and I think the key to a successful relationship is to love them with all your heart, and to always show them that you do. And of course to always be honest and I feel that a relationship should always be based upon honesty and acceptance. When you can fully accept yourself, honesty will come naturally. This in return will leave your partner feeling comfortable with you, knowing there is nothing to hide. If two people can see each other in full view with complete acceptance, they can build a successful relationship from this and The key is to be understanding. Nobody can change their personality, so we simply have to try to understand each other as we become closer and Friendship is most important in any relationship. I feel that if you can't be friends first what chance do you have at being lovers? With friendship you have to have trust and respect. You have to like the person you're friends with to get along together. Once that is accomplished falling in love with them is just an extension of friendship, only stronger and better. Like the foundation of a brick house, love must also have a foundation. That foundation is friendship. You must have a strong foundation (friendship) in order for love to withstand the test of time and Beside The most important key to success is making sure you call the person you care about or love, and be there whenever he/she needs you. Just care for that person with all your might.   What do u think now ?
*****************************************************************************

I want you to know that I believe that the most important 'key' to a successful relationship would have to be 'trust'. I believe that with trust, love will follow. However, what I have noticed is that many people think trust, or expect that trust is to be earned by the other person, when in all actuality it is something that comes from within yourself. All too many times people will say they don't trust due to past experiences. What they don't realize is that they have built up those proverbial walls to protect them from the very thing they are searching for... yes, there is a risk in trusting someone, but when you finally find that 'right' person, it makes all the past experiences and lessons learned very much worth the risk. All of life's little lessons do not have to be painful... even when they seem so at the time. You just have to chalk it up to experience and move on. Nothing is worth closing your heart. Nothing is worth living in a world of fearing what bad 'may' come to you. Without trust, you close your heart to the happiness and joy that true love brings. It's only my experience... and it's what I believe has given me the wonderful gift of 'true' love. It's a hard thing to do, a scary thing, but very much worth it. This is not to go without saying that some people may betray your trust... that's the risk... but why allow past betrayals to prolong the pain by building a fortress around your heart that not only protects you from pain/betrayal, but also denies you the ability to experience happiness and joy? Most have been hurt enough by one person, why allow them and their actions to stop us from finding what we search for? I say open your hearts to trust and bask in the beauty, happiness, and joy, of the true love that will follow. For everyone there IS a someone, you just can't find them if you hide away all your life. How about u?

I'm interested in poetry and music. Watching serials is not my passion, I prefer detectives, fantasy, historical and adventure films with a good plot. One thing I really enjoy is teaching. I love children so much and dream about my own ones. I like fitness trying to keep my body in a good shape. Occasionally I go skating with my friends and, frankly speaking, have a lot of fun, so as I'm not good at it yet. But hope to achieve success in this 'hard job'. Another thing I do better than skating is cooking. I often experiment in the kitchen, trying to make something unusual, and wait for a moment when I'll make my 'culinary masterpieces' for my beloved man.About me:The main thing I want to tell about myself is that I can appreciate people, their care and feelings. If a person comes into my life, he becomes an integral part of it, I am able to do much for our common happiness. I know what is trust and lie, love and betrayal and value good relations best of all. I am very inquisitive and active. New sides of our life and world makes me aspire to discover many interesting things all the time and improve myself. Most of all I hate to shame somebody. I'll never say pleasant to ear things to someone if I don't think so. Im a honest,trustworthy man and also a nice guy..Seeks Partner:25 - 55 years oldLooking For Men Type:I'm looking for a serious and kind man with a good sense of humour, who'll appreciate and respect me. I value understanding and support and so many other things.. But if we really feel attraction everything is going naturally and don't need to be mentioned. I believe that international marriages are the firmest. There are so many things we have to learn from each other and join two ways of thinking and living into our own one. Just create new wonderful world together! I'm lack of a person I could share my thoughts and life with. No matter what age or nationality you are. If you just want to love and to be loved, to wake up in the morning and enjoy just making coffee together, so we have a similar dream. And it's up to us to make our dream come true.

The first day we were introduced over the computer, I knew you were the one for me. The first hello and the first goodbye we both knew. It has been a little over 2 1/2 years, and we are still fondly in each other's minds, souls, and hearts. Before I met you I had no idea what love really was until my heart truly started aching for you. Every day we did not chat, and each day we are apart, tears ran down my face unconditionally for the longing of you near me. I never knew a man could have stolen my heart and made it truly his. I never knew I could love a man more then my own life. I long for the day I can finally look into your beautiful soft kind eyes and tell you how much I love you, and need you. The true beginning of my life is when when am there with u. These long years we have both waited, and all my dreams are finally coming true. I don't know about all of yours? Seeing you every day is going to be the biggest blessing to my heart knowing you are in touching reach of me, which does scare me, however in a wonderful way. You are my every heartbeat, my every gasping breathe of life. What I need to survive and make it through this lonely world can only be conquered with you by my side. I do not think there are any words that could describe the way I actually feel about you. All I know, is you, dear Miguel, are the only man that is in my mind, the only man that is in my soul, the only man who truly and unconditionally has my heart for my lifetime and many more lifetimes the world has to offer us. When I think about you, my eyes start to water because I know you are somewhere else and not in my arms. But the thought of you keeps me going and going for another breathe of fresh air to keep my longing for you in my life going. I will never leave, and I will truly never hurt you. I admire you. You are my inspiration for anything, and everything on this cold damp earth. I never thought my time would come to love, and then it came and I was hit with so much emotion and power I did not know where to put it all. I have stacked it piece by piece in my heart for you. I truly believe you are my soul mate, and you are the only man I will only give all I have to offer forever. I hope you never let go of me because I love you, and I know you love me too as much as I love you. Just the thought of you brightens my day completely, and sometimes I do bring you there on purpose to make myself happy when I am down. Picturing your smile makes me smile, and I cannot wait to actually see that adoring man I know with the unforgettable smile I know so soon. I treasure you locked in the big steel safe of my heart. I love you, sweetheart, and that is the only thing that is never going to change in my life. Always, and truly yours forever.

When I was a little girl, I dreamed of that one person that I would share my dreams, happiness and energy with ... I could not see his face but he was there. I always felt like he was out there, I just needed to feel him. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage he would give me to endure life's obstacles. All these years I was with others, and feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person that I am now. I have felt alone and sad. Then one day my eyes opened and I became that little girl again ... realizing that he is here now. Here in my world was the man that I had dreamed of and I'd hoped would not miss our meeting in life ... that man is you.
*********************************************************************

I have spent my life waiting ... not living, nor loving, but waiting. Waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to every expectation, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime but I will never be alone or waiting again. You brought to my cold empty heart the reason to live and to love with a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I know that one day I will come to you never to wait anymore.
***************************************************************************

I have lived for a long time, responsible for and dependent upon no one, answering to no one and committed to no one except myself. During this period of my life, I considered the world mine for the taking and truly believed that I was living life to the fullest. Then, you came into the picture, and all of a sudden, I realized that I was deceiving myself.I find that my life is not all that I thought it was. In fact, it is terribly lacking in many things, the foremost being love. Now, through some great fortune, I have found that love and along with it, the one person who can make my life truly complete.You are that person, and I have somehow fallen in love with you. To be honest, I never thought I would ever utter those words, but now, they come forth effortlessly and with great sincerity. I'll be forever be grateful to you for showing me just how shallow my life was. At last, I have a chance to give it depth and purpose.
*************************************************************

Here I am, heart and soul, confessing to the world how I feel about you. I would walk to the ends of the earth to meet you, and yet the funny thing is, looks as if I will have to do that since we haven't yet met. Funny how love works in people's lives. I sure never expected to neither meet nor find someone as amazing as you. You have touched my heart in so many ways and words couldn't even begin to explain to you the love I feel for you. Without further making it harder on the two of us to be together, I need to tell you that I love you and I am here waiting and when the time is right, will accept you as my husband and spend forever and eternity in your arms
************************************************************************

I can't stop thinking about you when we are apart. I need you by my side. You complete me. You mean the world to me. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are the one I've always wished for. I never thought that I would ever meet someone as special as you. Every day I wake up thanking God for you. You have given me so much, and I don't know if I will be able to give back all that you have given me. You have been my guiding light when I was lost. You have been my comforter through all my trials and sorrow. You have been my rock.Honey, you have changed my life completely. You're the one who makes me beautiful. You're the one who makes me strong. You're the one who makes me feel so important; you're everything to me.You show your love to me every day. I thank God that I have found a man like you. Please forgive me for not giving you enough time to chat with me, but I promise I will make up for it once we are together.I promise to always love you and always hold you in my heart. I will always be here for you when you need me, and I will love you no matter what life brings us. You are my soul mate, and I vow to love you all eternity. I love you, baby
********************************************************************************

I will always love you. My heart is yours, and even though I know I’ll make mistakes, I will never break your heart. I’ll be right beside you as we chase our dreams together, and you will never have to wonder if I still care. I think about you all day long and when I'm not near you my mind is consumed with thoughts of being close to you again. When you’re near me I feel like everything in the world is right, and I know I don't have to ask God for anything because as long I have you in my life I have everything I could ever want. All I want to do is spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you have made me.
**********************************************************************************

Ever since you walked into my life, I have been smiling. There hasn't been a day when I have gone to sleep with a frown on my face, and it's all because of you. Honey, I am glad that you came into my life. I have always wanted the love of my life to be understanding, loving, caring, faithful and most of all someone who would accept me for who I am. Now I have found the person I was looking for. My heart told me that my Prince Charming was there when get on Facebook. I knew that you were Mr. Perfect. I don't think that there is, or there could be, anyone better than you out there for me.
I love you with my whole heart. I have never trusted anyone the way I trust you. Sometime I even doubt myself, but I know I will never doubt you because you are my true love. I know deep down inside that you will never break my heart or never let me down in anyway.
Thank you honey for everything. I pray to god everyday to bless you with everything you deserve. I will love you until the end of time.
*************************************************************************

You are my everything. Thank you for loving me the way no one can. You understand me and you know just how to make things right. You will never know just how much I love you, but I will spend the rest of my days trying to show you. You saved me from the worst, and you are always there for me.  I love you for all eternity. Again, thank you, Baby. The fact that STILL I cannot find the words to describe exactly how my heart feels when I am with you, infuriates me. However, even if I had all descriptive vocabulary embedded unto my brain, I am sure that there still would not be a word that would fit exactly right.
******************************************************************************

Words alone can not express what I feel inside for you. I just want us to start all over with our lives together.  You have made me more happy in the short time I have known you then any man has ever made me in my whole life.  You make me laugh,make me smile and make me cry tears of happiness.  And what we have right now is so beautiful and it is not even physical.  I can not imagine how happy you can make me when you are able to make love to me.  You have become my friend,my soul mate,my comforter,and someday soon you will become my lover.  And all of this will last for all eternity.  All I want is to make you the happiest man in the world.  And I promise to do just that.  I want you and me to be a family.  I just hope u can accept me being with you.  Well love I better go and try to get some sleep.  I will dream of you and you are always in my thoughts.
****************************************************************************

I have really missed you Hunnie.I just want to let you know that you've helped me open my eyes and see myself truly. I was a person who was undecided, confused and sometimes forgot to plan, maybe because of the fate my life had given me. But now, I overcome it because you've helped me see my directions and gave me great confidence for my future.. You show me how to grow beyond myself. You made me see possibilities that I never knew.Thank you for sharing your life with me and I'm pretty sure I want to share my life and love with you too. The past will never matter for me now. I just want to think of what I have now ... I just want to think of you. I have found the last puzzle piece that completes me - it's YOU!My desire for you grows with each day that passes. I love everything about you. You are a warm, loving, sensitive, charming man with a sense of humor. I find you very attractive. Words do not have to be spoken to know how you feel about me too,I only want to be with you, please you, give you the same happiness that you have given to me. If I were granted but one wish, it would be to spend an eternity with you. I love you Honey

I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to wake up to you every morning. I want to hear you breathing while you're sleeping. You make my life complete and you make me feel like I can touch the sky a million times. I'm lucky to have you with me. Thanks for showing me what true love is, and for helping
me find my reason to live.
********************************************

I've never felt this kind of love since I've found you. I feel so lucky - the luckiest girl ever in the world because you made me happy all the time.Thank you for everything, Baby. I have no words to say and I'm out of words because I don't know how to thank you. Thank you for loving me and thank you for accepting me for who I am. You're my everything and you're my new world! I love you for being you and I love you for what you are.
*************************************

Today, I want to tell you about how much I love you and think about you: my days and nights are now brighter then anything 'cause I have my Moon on my lap. Yes, Dear, you make me feel extraordinary. I feel myself flying and feel that the world is such a beautiful place now. Thank you so much for your love and your care which you give me every second of my life, and thank you so much for your advice, your prayers and your love for me.I really adore you and want to give your my hearty feelings. I want to give you a special prayer: God bless you and may you live long." No one can take your place. And listen, I'm here for you every second of my life with lots of love and best wishes.
***************************************************************************

We compliment each other in everything we do, making each other stronger. You'll never forget to let me know just how much you love me and I never forget to let you know just how much I love you as well. You're the love of my life and U'r My Soulmate
When I think of what our lives could be like together in the future, I get butterflies and chills all over - it's just so exciting! I think something like this does happen to everybody; I'm just so lucky it's happened to me now.
********************************

You've filled all the cracks in my soul and you've made me a better person, Baby. If it weren't for you, I honestly don't think I could've made it to this day as successfully as I have. I love you with all my heart and soul, Baby; you know that, and Baby, don't believe for a second that anything could change it. My happiness is prolonged only because of you.
**************************************************

You're basically all I think about, Baby; when I'm not thinking about you, whatever I'm thinking about has to do with you. You're my everything, my existence, my love, my mental status, everything, and I want to thank you for being the person you are ... no matter what people say, Baby. I love you!
There's nothing that I need to hide from you, nothing I can't tell you; there are no uncomfortable silences, no secrets, and no reason to suspect anything unusual. Our relationship has none of the qualities that make other relationships fail - it's almost too perfect, but just right at the same time.
************************************************************************************************

You made a believer out of me. Every night before I sleep, a smile comes to my face because you are on my mind. In the mornings, with the dread of a long day ahead, your words soothes me and gives me strength to go on. How sweet it is to be in ecstasy with someone you adore in every sense. Your mind captivated me, your benevolence left me in awe and you stole my heart. Thank you for being you and loving me.
**************************************************************************************************************

I've fallen deeply in love with you. There are no words to express the gratitude I feel in my heart that you came into my life, and how you make every day so special. You are my life, my heart, my soul. You are my best friend, my one true love, my one and only. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you more tomorrow than I do today.I think about you every second of every day. When I fall asleep, my dreams are about you. When I wake up, I look at the empty pillow next to me and wish you were there looking into my eyes.
*******************

Inside of me there is a place where my sweetest dreams reside, where my highest hopes are kept alive, where my deepest feelings are felt and where my favorite memories are safe and warm. I find that you're on my mind more often than any other thought. Sometimes I bring you there purposely just to make my day brighter. But more often, you surprise me and find your own ways into my thoughts. There are even times when I awaken, I realize that you've been a part of my dreams. Then during the day, when my imagination is free to run, it takes me into your arms and allows me to linger there knowing there's nothing I'd rather do. I know my thoughts are only reflecting the loving hopes of my heart because whenever they wander, they always take me to you.
***************************************************************

Nobody has ever made me feel like the way you make me feel and that is such a crazy feeling. It feels like I just want to grab you and be in your arms forever and forever and never let go. I want to kiss your lips and never end - just keep going.Every time I think about you, it gives me more and more strength with which to carry on my life. It makes me happy to be alive knowing that you have came into my life and all I know is that I want to be with you!
***************************************

When I talk to you, it makes my heart beat faster, and feels like some sweet feelings, unexplainable, not understandable. I feel your presence everywhere by me,your talks remind me that you really exist, and I want you bad enough like the roses would need their perfume, like wind needs its songs, like snow needs its whiteness, like a little child wants ice cream. I did not plan to love you, it just happened.
I will keep loving you as long as the sun keeps shining, the stars keep brightening the sky, the winds keep blowing, the snow keeps falling, and the flowers keep smiling. I humbly request you, Yara, be mine. Loving you forever...
*******************************

My heart is hungry for your love, but my mind is aware of what it cannot have. I know we in different worlds so then why did you come and change everything around in my life? I thought I didn't want to love again, I thought I wouldn't be able to since my heart has hurt so much.To even say I do - it's a scary thought, but you came along and I became fearless of it.
It's hard to explain myself or to put it together in one, the only easy thing to think of is loving you. For just one look into your eyes will make everything in the world and in my life seem to disappear. You make me want to see the sunrise every day, to know it's another day where I can maybe have you by my side. I know faith can make this work someday if I just keep up my hope, 'til then I'll think of you just like now; your touch will forever caress me with tenderness, and your kisses will keep the flame in my heart alive in hope that one day you and I will be together..
********************************************************

I have so much inside my heart that it keeps me from breathing sometimes. I know we just met but these feelings that I have for you keep glowing and growing every day. Now that I am with you, I sleep thinking about you and the next morning I wake up smiling.
It's amazing how you got me and trapped me. I never thought I could love this much but I was so wrong. I just thank God for having you. We are meant for each other and no one can change that. I love you with ALL my heart.


I love you because you make me look forward to each day. You're my everything, a dream come true. There are no words to express what I feel for you. There are no songs as beautiful as the music that fills my soul when I hear your voice. There are no roses as lovely as your smile. Nothing moves me like you do. There are no days brighter than the days I spend talking to you on the phone. You're my light in the darkness. There could never be words strong enough to express my love for you. I love you with my body, soul, and mind. You're my everything. I love you so much, !
You, you, you and you alone... you shall reign in my heart. You are the one I desire without whom I could not be complete. I will live for you alone and I will work for you alone. I will share with you my thoughts, my heart, my mind and my body. I am waiting to receive you. I will never use force on you not even by words. In your presence, I will always be honest, transparent and sincere. I want always to be at your side... I love you
In all the dreams I've had in life, being with someone as great of a person as you, seemed impossible to find. You are everything I dreamed of and even more.I LOVE YOU I will give you my life, my love and share everything I have to offer with you. I will Honor you, cherish you, be loyal to you, and put no one else before you, forever! Please stay by my side as my Husband for all eternity. My heart mind, body and soul are yours. Simply... I love you.

Your happiness means everything to me. I love you more than you could possibly know and my love keeps growing every time I see you struggling to make me happy. I love you, Baby, now and always.

Without you I would simply be surviving, but with you I am living life to the fullest. Because of your love my spirit has been rejuvenated.
The simplest pleasures in life bring me so much joy that it is hard to find the words to describe them. A walk in the park becomes a reality based metaphor... it is our journey together hand in hand forever more.
It isn't about looks, nor money but the simplicity in life that we find so attractive. Knowing we could survive anywhere as long as we were together
Love is not a job, love simply is. Unconditional love is what I offer you, and with you I receive the same. You are my heart of hearts, my soul mate, friend, lover and partner for life.
I will love you forever and a day. Thank you for being there, loving me and knowing what my true heart wants.
**************************************************
I love you from now until death do us part.I don't want to lose you for anyone else or anything that anyone has to say about you. I want you to know that I love you from the deepest part of my heart. My love for you is unconditional. The love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time and I am just at a lost for words when it comes to you.  I want you to know that I love you and always will and there is nothing that will ever change that about how I feel...I love you.

Since you came into my life, I've been so happy. The fact that we're a thousand miles apart is not a matter at all because you are always in my heart. You told me that I'm the right one. I cannot tell you how good that made me feel. I am waiting for the days to make our dreams come true. I'll wait for you for a lifetime if you want me to. Do you know why? Because you are the only one who sees me while I am invisible to others. I hope you never quit seeing how much my love for you is true.



If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of this beautiful feeling that I have for you, I love you so dearly, sweetie. Do you know? You are the best thing that ever happened to me. You are like the best poetry ever composed, the best song ever played, the best picture ever painted. I love you sweetie, more than my life... more than my world. You are my world. Life wouldn't be life if not shared with you. It just feels so wonderful knowing and believing that. Aren't we lucky? I love you... more and more each day.
 ********************************************************************************************************
I have never in my life met someone more beautiful, enjoyable, loving, and comforting as you. Since the very first day that you smiled at me I knew there was something very special about you. I had no idea then that I would fall in love, but now that I have, I am so grateful. I am grateful for us to have wandered into one another's world so softly and unexpectedly. Nature took its course on our hearts and joined them in a way never imaginable.

I want you to know, that from the very depths of my heart, I love you. And I love everything that creates you, from your hair - that I wish I could play in more often... to your forehead - that I wish I could kiss while you sleep; from your eyes - that sparkle when you smile (just for me)... to your nose - that I wish I could rub my nose against; from your lips - that I just know were made perfectly to fit against mine... to your chin - that I would love to place my finger under to pull you close for a kiss; down your neck and to your heart - that in my own, I claim as mine, and down past every inch of every part of your existence.

I wish more than anything that you and I could grow together, love together, learn together, and laugh together, forever. I sincerely feel that between the two of us, we have the kind of love that some people never get a chance to experience. I promise to love you as much as I can, as best as I can, and for as long as I can. And no matter what, it's very important to me for you to know that you are an irreplaceable spirit that will always be a part of me.
I love you so very much sweetheart. You are the love of my life. I have a hard time explaining how I feel. I have never felt anything like this before. You are always there for me no matter what. I do not know what I would've done this week without your love and support. You are the most loving, caring, compassionate and absolutely most awesome guy that I have ever met. Antonio holds a special place in my heart, but you have gone way above and beyond him.

I never thought that was possible. I want to marry you now, I want to be your wife. I want a baby with you; that is the most awesome experience, nothing compares to that. You are a wonderful father to our kids, but you deserve more. Thank you for always being there, for the flowers - they are beautiful, for your kind words, hugs, kisses, and the unconditional love. You are a dream come true and I want to spend the rest of my life with you as your wife, lover, and best friend. I have never in my life been so very happy. I feel much loved, beautiful and very happy.

I'm so very proud of you. You are a very strong person. It is really cool that we are strong for each other in different ways. We totally understand each other and feel for each other. When you hurt, I hurt. When you are happy, I'm happy. I just love you so much sweetheart and I never want to lose you. I give you my heart, my love and my life for now and forever. I love you.
You came into my life and I wasn't sure how to react. I was so pulled to you and yet so wrapped up in my own narrow vision I almost lost you. Thank you for not giving up on me. For having the "Faith" to keep trying. I have never loved as I love you; so completely, so unconditionally, like no other.

When I told you, "Forever," I meant it and forever hasn't gotten here. I love you!

Im not here for my studies,i came here with my grandma when my parent died when we were in the state,my parent died in a fatal car accident on their way coming back from a friend's house in bronx for a thanks giving night,so the bank associate came the next year that my dad died to come take over his house,coz he took a loan from them before he died and he didnt pay up and he used his house as a collateral for the loan,so we were thrown out of the house,so my grandma got no choice than to bring me to her house here in africa so that we can be living here together

                                                                                                                                                   7
It's me Venessa again .  I want you to know that I believe that the most important 'key' to a successful relationship would have to be 'trust'. I believe that with trust, love will follow. However, what I have noticed is that many people think trust, or expect that trust is to be earned by the other person, when in all actuality it is something that comes from within yourself. All too many times people will say they don't trust due to past experiences. What they don't realize is that they have built up those proverbial walls to protect them from the very thing they are searching for... yes, there is a risk in trusting someone, but when you finally find that 'right' person, it makes all the past experiences and lessons learned very much worth the risk. All of life's little lessons do not have to be painful... even when they seem so at the time. You just have to chalk it up to experience and move on. Nothing is worth closing your heart. Nothing is worth living in a world of fearing what bad 'may' come to you. Without trust, you close your heart to the happiness and joy that true love brings. It's only my experience... and it's what I believe has given me the wonderful gift of 'true' love. It's a hard thing to do, a scary thing, but very much worth it. This is not to go without saying that some people may betray your trust... that's the risk... but why allow past betrayals to prolong the pain by building a fortress around your heart that not only protects you from pain/betrayal, but also denies you the ability to experience happiness and joy? Most have been hurt enough by one person, why allow them and their actions to stop us from finding what we search for? I say open your hearts to trust and bask in the beauty, happiness, and joy, of the true love that will follow. For everyone there IS a someone, you just can't find them if you hide away all your life.   How about u?

======================================================Qualities Of A Good Relationship===============================================================================
                                                                                                                                  8

    I think a good relationship requires being each other's best friend, and trusting one another. I think each should respect the other's opinion and that stupid arguments over stupid things are healthy, as long as they are not taken too far.

    Good communication. Never being ashamed of each other for any reason. On occasion surprising your mate with a nice romantic date or evening together and telling each other I love you.

    There is a lot of love and caring in the relationship. There has to be love in order for a relationship to work.

    A good relationship is when your partner is more than just a partner... they should be your best friend.

    A good relationship is when two lovers understand each other, they're concerned for each other and they respect one another.

    A good relationship is one purely based on trust, if nothing else. Being able to be miles apart yet never worrying a minute about what they're doing. Communication at all times is so important, and most importantly, respect for each other and their need for alone time as well as together time.

    Two people trusting each other fully, not being afraid to tell the other what one thinks, whether it be good or bad, and the other respecting their opinion. Being able to enjoy the same things with each other, enjoying each other, and being able to take their separate lives and smoothly combine their lifestyles into a couple's lifestyle.

    Being friends first, last and always. If you have friendship as the basis of your relationship, you can get through the hard times. The second ingredient is commitment. With those two things, you can't lose.

    A good relationship is two people that are not afraid to tell the other anything that may come up in the relationship. Best friends. Honesty, devotion, love, and sense of humor.

    A good relationship exists when either individual has the freedom to leave but neither wants to.

    I honestly think that a good relationship is one where there are no secrets. You are completely open with each other. But the biggest key is that the other person knows the worst possible thing about you and they love you even more for it. On top of that you have to have faith and trust. So that when your man goes out with an old female friend you can completely trust him and know that no matter what happens, he will always come home to you. I know it may not seem like much but as long as you have that and love, you are in a wonderful relationship.

    I define a good relationship by the way you treat each other. You could hold them and run your fingers down the side of their face. Feel comfortable you know. And you can also define it with fighting. Fighting is not my favorite thing to do with my girlfriend. But it needs to be done. It's not a real relationship until you do fight.

    I would have to say good communication! Equality, LOVE, not just lust, and most of all, friendship is needed.

    For me, a good relationship is being able to open up to each other even about the simple things in life. A relationship between two people cannot grow without trust. Loving a person is not enough, because if you've got doubts building up inside then you your relationship won't work. A good relationship is also based on friendship because it is so much easier to love someone you truly know than someone you've met 5 minutes ago.

    I think it is where you can trust and respect each other; when you can have passion and romance whenever and wherever you wish.

    A good relationship is when the two of you can actually feel better about your relationship after an argument; it's when you can really respect each other's differences and openly discuss feelings at all times.

    You have good relationship where there is compromise, honesty, sensitivity, and a feel for the needs and wants of the other person and yourself.

    When the couple listens and doesn't interrupt when they're trying to work out a fight. They care for each other deeply. They share similar interests.

    A good relationship is when both parties can freely express themselves with one another and to have that open connection to be able to say anything to each other. To have trust and faith in one another. Basically a honest, trusting, loving and open relationship.

    A good relationship is frankness and open-minded communication between friends. It is a two-way communication without dominance and/or hypocrisy in it.

    A good relationship isn't necessarily flawless, because human beings aren't flawless. It's more important that you can grow with the person you love. If you can learn and grow each day with your best friend standing by you in body and in spirit-then you have a good relationship.

    When you can feel comfortable about everything together. Always being able to talk, joke. Taking your commitment seriously with one another and never taking each other for granted.

    A good relationship must a give and take basis, in order for you to understand each other. Never fail to listen and understand the situation your in to. Be open minded and be ready to any obstacle that will come in you're way.

    A good relationship is when both members fully trust each other and can have a blast with each other, knowing how to laugh and be there for each other.

======================================================================Relationship Essentials======================================================
                                                                                                                                                    9
    I think the most important key to a successful relationship is when you truly enjoy each other's company and I think the key to a successful relationship is to love them with all your heart, and to always show them that you do. And of course to always be honest and I feel that a relationship should always be based upon honesty and acceptance. When you can fully accept yourself, honesty will come naturally. This in return will leave your partner feeling comfortable with you, knowing there is nothing to hide. If two people can see each other in full view with complete acceptance, they can build a successful relationship from this and The key is to be understanding. Nobody can change their personality, so we simply have to try to understand each other as we become closer and Friendship is most important in any relationship. I feel that if you can't be friends first what chance do you have at being lovers? With friendship you have to have trust and respect. You have to like the person you're friends with to get along together. Once that is accomplished falling in love with them is just an extension of friendship, only stronger and better. Like the foundation of a brick house, love must also have a foundation. That foundation is friendship. You must have a strong foundation (friendship) in order for love to withstand the test of time and Beside The most important key to success is making sure you call the person you care about or love, and be there whenever he/she needs you. Just care for that person with all your might.   What do u think now ?

Am feeling u are something very new and i guess ur coming into my life will be a plus.I hope we'll never part,because I know a strait forward man will always treat His woman with love,care and Passions...I wrote your name in the sky, but the wind blew it away.I wrote your name in the sand, but the waves washed it away.I wrote your name in my heart, and forever it will stay,i promise i will always Love and Adore you if you are serious about me,my love for you will be like a golden chain that links our heart together,if you ever break the chain that means you break my heart,i believe you wont because i know you are serious about me......I really want to see u someday.i should be home as soon as i receive my School leaving Certificate,i will be here waiting for you to get back to me with your pics as promised,have a nice time at work..

Hello Darling,
    Thank you very much for your reply i am so great full that  you are so serious and i am here to let you know i am also serious  hope you gonna take good proper care of me..because the way u talk is making me really wanna be with you so badly course  life is so unpredictable. Changes always come along, in big or small ways. I don't know what happened that this sudden change has turned my world upside down. I don't know exactly what it is, it just hit me, but there is something really special about you and the email u just sent to me . That no other men on earth have done or say to me.Our love started over the net and everything seemed almost perfect then. We had never met but the love we felt was so big and true already, and could only become complete by meeting each other,hunny am very happy for all the love you have been given to me and i will always be there for you in all things in life you need my king. The very first day I'm going to met you in person, we are going to hold one other so tightly. we wont want to let any one go, and time will stood still. We had a perfect day and we knew it could only get better and better if we only stood by each other, held, kissed and hugged. After that moment we never went through a day without saying how much we love and need each other for the rest of our life,Being far away from you is killing me rite now, not sharing every day with you and not being able to hold you whenever I want, hurts so much but I know that at the end of all this pain I will find you.  So Hun i need to stop hear now and try to finish what am doing and then email you back when u reply this mail.
with love,

Dear Love,
     You are a blessing that my entire being is very thankful for. I feel that we were made to love, listen, understand, and work through all times in our lives together and individually.I feel that we have shared more time together than we ever will and I know there are many more special occasions and moments in our lives that will surprise and bring us closer.You are my soul mate and nothing, and no one else feels more right than you!! I love you eternally and unconditionally. God's love has answered this prayer I've wanted and been almost too anxious for so long. I miss you more than words can say and my love will reach any distance and fly to be in your dreams and heart each evening that we can not be together. I physically long for you each night and will see you in my dreams until we find ourselves wrapped in the love that grows stronger and deeper each day, into our future together....... I believe and have faith in you.
Love Always,

Hello there love,  I am just sitting here thinking of you and crying.  I miss talking to you so much.  It seems like the only time I am ever happy any more is when I am talking with you.  I am just really lonely right now.  And I could use a great big hug from you.  You will never know just how important you are to me!!  Words alone can not express what I feel inside for you. I just want us to start all over with our lives together.  You have made me more happy in the short time I have known you then any man has ever made me in my whole life.  You make me laugh,make me smile and make me cry tears of happiness.  And what we have right now is so beautiful and it is not even physical.  I can not imagine how happy you can make me when you are able to make love to me.  You have become my friend,my soul mate,my comforter,and someday soon you will become my lover.  And all of this will last for all eternity.  All I want is to make you the happiest man in the world.  And I promise to do just that.  I want you and me to be a family.  I just hope u can accept me being with you.  Well love I better go and try to get some sleep.  I will dream of you and you are always in my thoughts.
Love you
Nancy

Good Morning Hunnie  ,
    Hunnie,How are you?I have really missed you Hunnie.I just want to let you know that you've helped me open my eyes and see myself truly. I was a person who was undecided, confused and sometimes forgot to plan, maybe because of the fate my life had given me. But now, I overcome it because you've helped me see my directions and gave me great confidence for my future.. You show me how to grow beyond myself. You made me see possibilities that I never knew.Thank you for sharing your life with me and I'm pretty sure I want to share my life and love with you too. The past will never matter for me now. I just want to think of what I have now ... I just want to think of you. I have found the last puzzle piece that completes me - it's YOU!My desire for you grows with each day that passes. I love everything about you. You are a warm, loving, sensitive, charming man with a sense of humor. I find you very attractive. Words do not have to be spoken to know how you feel about me too. When I look into your eyes, I can feel your desire for me. I only want to be with you, please you, give you the same happiness that you have given to me. If I were granted but one wish, it would be to spend an eternity with you. I love you.Hunnie When you are up from sleep please email me okay.I love you so much Hunnie.
 
  Have a Nice day at work Hunnie

Hello My love,
How are you doing?Have been thinking about you all day long and I wil like to know how is your health over there and what is new with you?I do trust you with my heart and I will never let you down.. I cant wait to meet you and be with you for real,The first day we were introduced over the computer, I knew you were the one for me. The first hello and the first goodbye we both knew. It has been a little over some days, and we are still fondly in each other's minds, souls, and hearts. Before I met you I had no idea what love really was until my heart truly started aching for you. Every day we did not chat, and each day we are apart, tears ran down my face unconditionally for the longing of you near me. I never knew a man could have stolen my heart and made it truly his. I never knew I could love a man more then my own life. I long for the day I can finally look into your beautiful soft kind eyes and tell you how much I love you, and need you. The true beginning of my life is when I am going to be there with you. These long we have both waited, and all my dreams are finally coming true. I don't know about all of yours? Seeing you every day is going to be the biggest blessing to my heart knowing you are in touching reach of me, which does scare me, however in a wonderful way. You are my every heartbeat, my every gasping breathe of life. What I need to survive and make it through this lonely world can only be conquered with you by my side. I do not think there are any words that could describe the way I actually feel about you. All I know, is you, dear , You are the only man that is in my mind, the only man that is in my soul, the only man who truly and unconditionally has my heart for my lifetime and many more lifetimes the world has to offer us. When I think about you, my eyes start to water because I know you are somewhere else and not in my arms. But the thought of you keeps me going and going for another breathe of fresh air to keep my longing for you in my life going. I will never leave, and I will truly never hurt you. I admire you. You are my inspiration for anything, and everything on this cold damp earth. I never thought my time would come to love, and then it came and I was hit with so much emotion and power I did not know where to put it all. I have stacked it piece by piece in my heart for you. I truly believe you are my soul mate, and you are the only man I will only give all I have to offer forever. I hope you never let go of me because I love you, and I know you love me too as much as I love you. Just the thought of you brightens my day completely, and sometimes I do bring you there on purpose to make myself happy when I am down. Picturing your smile makes me smile, and I cannot wait to actually see that adoring man I know with the unforgettable smile I know so soon. I treasure you locked in the big steel safe of my heart. I love you, sweetheart, and that is the only thing that is never going to change in my life. Always, and truly yours forever.I can't wait to miss to you my darling. I am so excited I cannot sleep knowing we will soon be together. it will be the best day yet in my life to kiss and hold you and every day will be better than the last my love. I love you so much and want you to be with me at this very instant baby. you are so wonderful Loving you comes to me Passionate and full Loving you is not hard For it is pure and true Loving you with each beat of my heart Even when i feel blue Loving you with all my heart Is something that I'll do No matter where I am I will always love you ..... I cant wait to meet you and Hold you tight in my arms,I do have a everything .,But all I need is the renewer of my Passport which cost $400  .., but I want you to assist me with the $400 so  i can get my passport renew.,In other to let this dream come true.. I will like you to tell me the Nearest Airport close to you??? ...I want things to work Out for Us and i want you to have faith and trust me with your heart and I want you to know that i do want the best for you..I want you to work things Out together so that we can make a Dreams come true..

Hello Husband,
             Good Morning My Love,I just Got Back From The Airport and i just wanna say Thanks for the mail,I think of you,Hun. You are so far away, yet so close in my heart. My heart and my body yearns for you. You brought love and laughter to my empty, sad and boring life. My heart had known only emptiness until the day you came and filled my heart to overflowing with your jovial ways. Your sense of humor has turned my frown into a smile.You taught me how to love again, you taught me to give and receive love by trusting in you and believing. You taught me to go the extra mile..... And though there are miles between us, I never stop thinking of you, you have brought a change into my life and my heart is forever yours.I can never forget you, or keep thoughts of you out of my mind.. Thoughts of you warm my heart. You complete me, you are everything my heart desire,How can I forget you when your always on my mind? How can I not want you when your all I want inside? How can I let you go when I can't see us apart? How can I not love you when you control my heart,You're always lighting up my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way.. You're my Life, and will forever be my Life
You will always be the love of my life, and please never give up, always have faith in yourself and you will gain the greatest gift of all, the gift of hope and love you righteously deserve. Every time I think of you my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together we grow closer.... I'm simply hanging by a moment, waiting to see you soon Hunnie,I will never forget you. I hope you still think of me too. I love you with all that I am,all that I was and all that I will ever be. Please know that my love and I are inseparable and I would want it no other way and if time could express my love for you then it's forever and a day, I can't wait to be with you, see your smile, look in your eyes, feel your sweet touch, hear your perfect words and kiss your perfect lips. The way I feel about you some people call it crazy, some call it insane, but I call it true love. I really love you
 
Hunnie i will email you my booking details as soon as i have my flight booked,Hunnie i have got a bad news ,Immediately we Leave Class today,the school authority called a short Notice,that there is an immediate meeting,on getting there we are told that we have to pay the sum of $425.20 for our school leaving Certificate,Hunnie its makes me feel sad because i never thought we are going to pay for the certificate but since its an order from the school authority,i have no power to querry their intention,Hunnie i will be very happy if you can just raise me with the fund because its just the only thing i need to do so that i can get back to the state,i am not forcing you into doing this but i thought i should tell you because it will hasten our meeting,i dont mean to ask you for this but i think i have no where to go than to let you know what is going on here
 
Time may take us apart, that's true,Hunnie it the right time for us to be together,I will always be there for you. You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams, no matter the miles between,You have my heart and soul. I know the miles between us are great.

My Love,
 
   My heart has already found it's way you. I want you and no one else. You mean everything to me. I think we should try and make this work. You have to know you're the one, and only one I want.

I am hoping you're feeling the same way because my heart is set on you, and only you, baby.

Kiss Kiss.
========================================================================
My vision of U,

In mind you are a purple orchid...exotic, tender, passionate and wild. Untouchable, fragrant bloom of dark desires...evoking my deepest thoughts Lost in the dreamy wonder of an eastern forest...You are there among the whispering glades...of soft green bamboo....delicately embracing the moist warm air of night....A lover of another world...of fantasies ethereal, yet profoundly real.....Earthy....My chocolate sweetness in distant lands.....A darkened flower of refined passion...... My purple orchid... you are. The abyss of my heart is enthralled by your undying love. I absorb your tender kisses with my lips. The a-cappella beat of your heart, close to mine, Reigns everlasting and true. In the acclivity of my soul once more I whisper, ("Again, you will come"). The grandeur of your embrace, The beauty of your touch. I`ll take hold of your hand.....as we fly to heaven. My days are filled with sun, while passion rules the nights...and you there in my mind, never leaving my sight. Flowers on our table... flowers in my hair, petals on our bed, love everywhere. Kisses passed between two loving hearts...and promises that we will never part. Dreams I hold onto, grasping them close...knowing in my soul, I`m luckier than most. Wanting you here, needing more than a dream, sometimes so much, it makes me scream. Come to me love ...live in my day. I`ll love you forever in so many ways. I`ll give you the moon and take down the stars....I`ll live in your world, go where you are. Just whisper warm words close to my ear.. and I will give you forever. Three roses for you, my love, today...white perfection in a long stemmed creation. Fragrant, like a thousand perfumes everlasting, eternally blessed A gift of passion, Trinity...In our love... three elements, given.... Faith, Hope and Love.. Three precious gifts of light . For love will be, undeniable, yet challenged.... A world of conflict and separation...attempting togetherness? Driven by wild attraction, determination. Faith in the possibility, happiness Living in partnership, sharing...hope in the future together, fulfilling Loving, unconditionally, provocatively...Two lives in evolution, sharing... Living in harmony in adversity....Faith, Hope and Love....The three perfect roses for I await from a love.

   You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe, but more importantly, you make me feel wanted. Something that I hadn't felt in a very long time. We both knew our friendship would grow right from the very first day we spoke. But, neither one of us could begin to imagine the love we both feel, not exploding or thundering into our hearts, but just slowly growing into a beautiful relationship that only you and I can understand. We don't even need to be together, we are never apart. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, my love.

Yours John.
========================================================================
My Love,

  I just want to let you know that you've helped me open my eyes and see myself truly. I was a person who was undecided, confused and sometimes forgot to plan, maybe because of the fate my life had given me. But now, I overcome it because you've helped me see my directions and gave me great confidence for my future. You show me how to grow beyond myself. You made me see possibilities that I never knew.

Thank you for sharing your life with me and I'm pretty sure I want to share my life and love with you too. The past will never matter for me now. I just want to think of what I have now .... I just want to think of you. I have found the last puzzle piece that completes me - it's YOU!Today's and I love you, tomorrow I will still love you and I want to keep on loving you till the days end.

I love you, Baby!

Love always,
John.

Dearest Heart,

Hi, Baby, you're always lighting up my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my baby, and will forever be my baby. You will always be the love of my life, and please never give up, always have faith in yourself and you will gain the greatest gift of all, the gift of hope and love you righteously deserve.

Every time I think of you my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together we grow closer. I'm simply hanging by a moment, waiting to see you again so you can hold me so tight that all else fades; I thought after you left you would fade away from my mind, but still everyday I wake up dreaming of our time together.

I will never forget you. I hope you still think of me too. I love you with all that I am, all that I was and all that I will ever be. Please know that my love and I are inseparable and I would want it no other way and if time could express my love for you then it's forever and a day. I can't wait to be with you, see your smile, look in your eyes, feel your sweet touch, hear your perfect words and kiss your perfect lips. The way I feel about you some people call it crazy, some call it insane, but I call it true love. I really love you, Baby Bear.

Love always,

John  stop forXXXXXX

What a Dream Honey,

    I went to bed last night with a vision of you next to me. I slept like a baby all night, because I was not feeling alone. When I awoke this morning to see if it was real or if it was a dream, realty hit me that it was only a dream. Very soon, I know that you will be right next me, and that I will not have to dream of it again because you will be right there so we can hold, hug and squeeze each other tight. Baby, I long to be there with you so I can help build you and support you, so that we can accomplish a whole lot together as husband and wife.

Love you.
========================================================================
Dear Love,

I love you with all my heart! I will never forget all of the good times we have had together and I will definitely never forget you and the way you have changed me. I have never felt this way about any other woman I've met; you have made me the happiest man in the world! When ever i read from you my heart just rushes by and I can't even begin to explain how you make me feel, but it's the best feeling in the world. I swear every time I hear your name my heart just skips a beat! You are the most wonderful thing ever. You have absolutely no idea how much I really love you but trust me, it's more than you will ever know. I hope we last forever and thanks for everything you do, Babe. I love you always and forever.

Love always,

Your Baby,

Tony

Good Morning Honey,
  Just wanna make you Understand some other things you dont seems to Understand, There Are so much I want to tell you, a lot has been running through my head lately. I'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words so you will have to bare with me through this.

I keep thinking about the future, about life, and what I want out of it. I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me. I keep thinking about these things and I realize they go hand in hand. This relationship is my future; it's what I want out of life. I want to grow old with you. I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever, and I really think I'm going to get to. I want us to walk through new houses picking the one that would be just right for us. I want to see you walk around our house in a big t-shirt with your hair down and catch me staring at how gorgeous you are. I want you to pull the covers off me at night and then I have to get even closer, if it's possible, to you to keep warm. I want to see you laugh like crazy at me when I do stupid stuff. I want to rub lotion all over your body because you laid out in the sun too long.. I want to have a child with you and go through the experiences of parenthood with you. I want to see you and me chasing our little kid around the house, all three of us laughing our heads off and having fun. I want to hold you when you cry and smile with you when you smile. I want to fall asleep every night with you in my arms. I want you to fall asleep on my chest listening to the beat of my heart and know it beats for you I want you to be the first thing I see when I wake up and the last thing I see when I go to sleep. I want to see your bad morning hair; I think it will be so cute. I want to sit on the beach with you and watch the sun set, and I want all the people who pass us to envy the love that we obviously have for each other.

I want to see you walk down that isle and I want to take your hand for the rest of my life. I want to spend all night, and maybe the next day, making love to you with an undying passion (sorry to be so blunt). I want to be thirty years old and still make out with you like a little schoolboy. I want to cook a meal with you and us totally ruin it and end up doing take out. I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing at all but in the same time everything or maybe we won't talk at all and just grin at each other realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to bust out laughing when you try to yell at me. I want to lay with you in front of a fireplace and keep the heat going long after the fire goes out. I want to take trips with you to places we've never been and experience them together. I want us to go skinny-dipping in a hotel pool and get caught and streak back to our hotel room waking everyone up because we're laughing so hard. I want us to go and pick out the hot tub we want with the biggest grins on our faces the whole time. I want the sales rep to get embarrassed when we sit in them and make sure we have enough room to do the things we want to do. I want our friends to come over and get totally jealous because they don't share a love like we do. I want to be walking into a store with you and trip and fall on my face and turn around to see you rolling on the ground laughing at me. I want us to run outside in the rain and act like total kids getting completely soaked, and when we come back in stripping down to nothing as we stumble into the bedroom, or the kitchen counter, or the balcony, or the dining room table, or an office desk, or the shower, which ever one we feel like at the time.

I want it to take your breath away every time I say, "I love you" because you know it's coming from the heart.I want us to sit down with a box of strawberries, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and a thing of mint chocolate ice cream; well, I'll let your imagination finish that one.. I want to love you and be with you for at least forever if not a little longer. I couldn't really express in words what I'm feeling right now so I decided to share with you SOME of the images and thoughts that have been running through my head.I just want you to know that I had never found someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with until I met you. I really am crazy about you, everything about you.

Love always,

Tony.
