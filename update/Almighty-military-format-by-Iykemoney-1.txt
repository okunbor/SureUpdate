My wife died of cancer three years ago.
or 
I had a fiancee but she died of cancer three years ago. We've been together since 2005. Since then i have been on Deployment, first was in Iraq and currently I'm In Kabul Afghanistan. Apparently, time never seemed right for me to enter into any steady relationship. I have until November this year before My contract Terminates with the OFS Afgha.I'm sure this will be my last deployment for a long period of time.
====================================I'm currently stationed in Kabul Afghanistan for a peace keeping mission. 
I was deployed last year in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel as a member of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force.
=====================================
I'd like to know more about  your background, education,life experiences, your goals and dreams, your interests, and anything else you want to tell me.
-------------------------------------
Well, I'm a single father of lovely daughter..I was Born on sep 7th in Austin.Lost my Parents in a Car Crash at the Age of 15. This was my worst life moment.Moved to live with my late Uncle who was a Military Priest. I signed up for the Army shortly after 9-11 Attack, Studied Criminology and Information System ..I currently work with the US Special Forces Operational Detachment Team....Currently Stationed in Kabul Afghanistan. I hope to return home and be with my daughter in November. I hope to settle down once again and be with a lovely, caring and Family Oriented woman..I have deep passion for sports, fitness Exercise, Music, Out door activities. My favorite color is Blue and Black and Favorite meal is Rice and Chicken with Pasta..lol. I'm also the shy type because i grew up to be an introvert but that has changed with time.
-------------------------------------
I had a very rough and tough childhood when my parents died at 15,
My relatives abondoned me due to family vendettas.
I had to pass through several  Hardships and adversities to become the man I'm today.
Joining the military offered me a better chance of survival.
I'm thankful to God Almighty that I'm still Alive today. 
Without his grace and mercies, i would be dead by now. 
I have lost quite a good number of friends since i came here last year,
but i still stand firm and alive today.

This song by Marvin sapp inspires me a lot. I think it's my favorite gospel song.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I came to realize that she's unfaithful to me.
She lives a very promiscuous life while I'm away. It's hurt a lot to see someone you love mess around with your friend.
Chat conversation end

=====================================
Since my wife's death, my life has been filled with making some certain decisions about my career, trying to meet with new friends, counting my blessings and facing squarely the challenges and vissisitudes that life has presented including being a single father.
------------------------------------
I have intensions to begin a new life and settle down once more when my contracts here is over. 
All i want and always prayed for is a caring, loving, family-oriented and  dedicated woman to be the mother of my daughter.

I truly believe in Gods time, all the people and life lessons we experience, are part of the big plan he has for us.

        About you!!!
I am a man of High Moral Integrity, Kind, honest,funny, and very Supportive.I'm a man with a soft heart, loving, caring, honest, compassionate and affectionate,I also believe in God.I live a very understanding life and am easy to talk to. I'm dependable and Loyal.I respect women a lot,I am generally a happy person and i always try to see the best in people,I'm very young at heart, lively, energetic with lots of interests,I'm a man of principles,and romantic,i love to traveled a lot..I'm independent and self-sufficient...
====================================

I aslo want you to know that I'm chatting you live from the Military command center here in Kabul where i  work as an information system analyst. 
My Job here in the Tactical operation unit is to monitor military Intelligence,Survillience, network administration, database management and computer hardware and software implementation.
Sometimes i aslo join the combat team on special missions and beat Patrols when it is required of me.

I must tell you that things work very differently here when compared to the real world. 
We call it the control or war room, it is heavenly secured and monitored constantly.
Most times it is very difficult to have a personal conversation without having them decoded and recorded by the military Authorities.This is to ensure discipline among our troops.

Talking with you here on FB is safe as long as i don't get caught.
Most soldiers find it dificult to cope and would sneak out of camp to get the satisfaction they desire.
Though a heavy penalty await those who default the camp rules.

I know i shouldn't be telling you all of these but i see you as a very understanding and caring woman.
I want you to know that i find pleasure chatting with you not withstanding these rules.

Obama refused to re-deploy some of our troops who have being serving here for quite a long time unless by emergency leave which is often times not granted.

Our politicians use us to enrich themselves and increase their statues at the detriment of our lives and families....We risk ourselves here for alost nothing.


Day 11-15
====================================
Building real Love*****Love Builder.
===================================
I don't know how to approach this with you online.
I have been fighting a terrible battle within myself since we met.
My heart says i should tell you how i feel but my head tells me not to be stupid that it will only cause a terrible damage to our new friendship. And that you wouldn't be interested.
-------------------------------------
It is very important for me to tell you how cute and lovely you are.
------------------------------------- 
I wish I could do this in person while gazing into your eyes,but since we are physically separated by miles of emptiness, this expression must come in the form of letters such as this.
-------------------------------------
I know that distance dosen't allow actions to be felt but trust me, our words can convey our feelings when distance hinders.
-------------------------------------
As the saying goes: "True Love and Friendship knows no boundaries and no distance; 

If what i felt for you is real, then distance mean absolutely nothing in the face of love for love dosen't count by the miles...It's measure by the heart.
-------------------------------------
I want to spend the next phase of my life with you baby.
************************************
What do you have to say?
*************************************
It's a great pleasure to be you friend and a greater one to be able to look into our future and see a mixture of serenity, hope, love and happiness.
-------------------------------------
This fairly recent relatioship of ours is something i consider sacred already. Our connection is divine.
Believe me, this friendship is so precious to me, i intend to keep it till the end of my days on earth.
-------------------------------------
The test of true love is not when we are together, It comes when we are far apart and still realize that despite the distance, our thoughts and feelings are still conveyed.
-------------------------------------
Sometimes, I wish you were here or that I am there, or that we were together anywhere because this is a rather unconventional way of starting up a relationship.
What we started as a mere internet contact has turned into a stronger bond between two peple that have now discovered the true meaning of loving in an unconventional way.
-------------------------------------
I have learnt a lot from this relationship. I have seen what's like to trust and give yourself completely to the other person when are so far apart.
-------------------------------------
The Distance between two hearts is not an obstacle, rather a great reminder of just how strong true love can be.
=====================================
Transaction*****Trasactions****$$$$
=====================================
Emergency leave
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I would really love to see you soon baby,i cant imagine spending months here without meeting you,I think my contract might be extened till next year and this makes me go crazy each time i think about it.I don't want to lose you honey.
I would really want us to spend time with each other and behold great moments that will forever lingers in our minds.
####################################
We could make this a reality baby. 
We could be together in a couple of weeks if only i could be granted an Emergency Leave out of camp.
Emergency leaves are often not granted, but in cases of serious illness and marital arragement, a soldier can be granted an emergency leave out of Kabul.
Also, as a seargent (E7) and I'm entitled to a 31 day emergency leave provided i have a sort ofacquaintance to be my leave applicant and if we are able to meet up with the necessary requirements, then we are going to be together in a couple of weeks.
I haven't done it before but i know a couple of soldiers who have successfully got redeployd home with this medium.
-------------------------------------
I think there is a little cost attached to it. You have to write a formal letter to the deplartment of defense, leave board and request for my Emergency leave on marital basis.
Tell them i need to come back home ahead of our Marriage.

I have already spoken to my commandant about it.


I will get the military connect email address so that you can start the application from now.

Your letter should look like this baby.

US MILITARY DEPARTMENT
APPLICATION FOR EMERGENCY LEAVE

"I am (your complete name) from (your address) here by wish to apply for EMERGENCY LEAVE  on behalf of my fiance Sgt (your name)
(UN/US ARMY 009/16770/UNAMIL),MOS-18E\OFS
stationed in Eggers, Kabul Afghanistan.
I'm writing to ask if He can be granted an emergency leave vacation so that he can come home and prepare for our marriage rites.
I will be grateful if my request can be granted.
====================================
I have already taken time to speak with my commandant concerning you. 
I told him i would need an Emergency leave to come home and prepare ahead of our marriage which is supposed to take place this month. 

He advised that you should write a formal letter to the DOD, requesting for an emergency leave on my behalf.

This will take less time to achieve since miliatry Authorities gives much preference and aderence to Health and also soldiers seeking to fufil their marital rites.

I have search for the DOD military connect emal address. 
It is militarydepartment.o.defense@usa.com
I will give you my miliatry identification number, insatlation and unit.
