When you contact the agent, he/she will have to check on their automated
data base system if you are among the randomly selected people who can
get a Grant and then proceed to some other processes and have your
info and you will choose your Grant option and will have to pay for
the clearance of your file (case fee,file fee,label fee and shipping
fee) and once the cashier gets it and process your Grants documents
and certificates your Grant will be delivered to you the next day
after the confirmation by their UPS men



i was told to pay for clearance fee before the UPS can Deliver my
Grant Money i choose 90,000 and the charges was 2000 that all i did to
get my Grant Money

It is real, when a sister's friend of mine told me about it I was
scared and wondered if something that could be this true would be
real, and I contacted the agent and qualified and got my Grant money
delivered to me after I passed all the process




The Grant is from the office of the Federal Reserve inconjuction with
IMF and UNICEF to serve as an economic aid to all...
I mean a legitimate government employee or representative of the
Federal government will not hesitate to provide a link to information
concerning their agency's purpose.



It was the UPS men that brought it for me after I qualified. You will
have to go through a series of processes to check if you qualify and
once you qualify the agent will also tell you what next to do....It is
not like they will just give everyone a Grant.... They have an
automated database that has saved everyone's information. Once he
checks and sees you qualified he will check and take you through the
process


It was sent to me through a certified mail check from their
headquarters through UPS...And I took it to bank immediately to verify
if it was real and legit..And bank confirmed to me that it was real



He is the claim agent in charge of registering and distributing
Grants. He's the agent in charge

One more thing....Dont disclose your winning to anyone not until you
get your Grant we do this to make sure real winners get there money we
had situations where other people claim what is not theirs and when
you are making your payment do not disclose this to anyone because if
you do the IRS will be inform about your Grant and the IRS will charge
you 40% out of your Grant Money i hope you understand this?

=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================


Here is the information the UPS is going to ask you when they come to
make your deliver your winning money to you .. UPS LOGISTICA
UPS: MSMLtdRep.
Reff No: BE102/85428
Batch No: 281020001PRD
=======================================================================================================================================



Hello, i got a bad news from the UPS just now that IRS stopped them on
there way coming to make your delivery this morning....IRS told the
UPS that there is a Tax they must pay on the winning money before it
can be deliver for you and the amount is $6000.. That is the only
delay we have right now and you need to make another payment of $6000
to the UPS cashier so that they can clear the tax fees and deliver
your winning money to you.. Get back to me asap with the MTCN Control
number as soon as you make your payment.. Thanks
