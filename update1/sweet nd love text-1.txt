My Dearest ,Honey do you know that life can be cruel but when it all comes together there is no moment as sweet. That is how I feel about you entering my life. You have rekindled the flame called love in me. You have given one more reason to look forward to tomorrow. Now, you are a significant part of my life and I look forward to the day when we can make it permanent. I love you so much. I love you for your kindness, for your caring and giving nature, for your beauty - both inner and outer, and most of all I love you because you are you. The fact that you show me who you really are and not what you think I may want. Sweetie, let this letter be a testament to my true feelings for you. The whole world can see and know how I feel for you. I love you,Honey I love and wish i could be  kissing you, holding you, being with you, looking into your eyes knowing and hoping you feel the same way about me. I love you so much, words sometimes cannot express it. Your hugs and kisses . Every moment spent with you talking with you is a moment I cherish. You are my night sky. I look to you for everything in my life .






Honey i want you to know How nice it is to have you in my life, you are my everything, and I mean my everything. I still remember the first time we met; it will be like a puppy going home for the first time when you came to pick me up at the airport honey .I Know that The long waiting was finally over when i get in your arms .Honey I Know that  When our eyes met in person we will be happy together,it was like I knew from that day on that you were the one I would spend the rest of my life with forever.

I know we have problems, and everybody does - that means I will not give up on you, I love you so damn much! I can't stand being away from you, sleeping without you. Just having you there reassures me that everything will be alright.

You are like God's Angel, so Handsome, so Kind, so loving, caring, and that's what I love, the fact that you love me for who I am, not what you want me to become. Thank you, God, for this special man given to me ,I can't thank him enough for the love and kind that I found in you dear.

Yes, I fought cancer and won and now I'm going to fight for this love to get stronger than ever, and in time it will. Nothing can keep me from you, not even death, because with death, I bring you with me in my heart and in my soul



Hello my dear , Honey i want you to know that Love, an emotion so strong that you would give up everything. To just feel it once, to know that you are part of something special. To know that you can feel what love really is; to know, to feel, to love......Love and electricity are one in the same, my dear. If you do not feel the jolt in your soul every time a kiss is shared, a whisper is spoken, a touch is felt, then your not really in love at all.....To love someone is to understand each other, to laugh together, to smile with your heart and to trust one another. One important thing is to let each other go if you can't do this . . ... . The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain . I want you to know that we are meant to be and we need to go through obstacle as well before we get to the place where we are going too ...I am so much happy to be your heart queen and also to be called your last name .I Love you .

Honey do you Know that   While I lay here waiting to hear from you, I can't help thinking about what my life has become when you became a part of it. Waiting and wanting you has been the focus of my thoughts these days, knowing that one day, all that I have envisioned of us being together, will finally happen, even if it's just for a moment. You give me reason to wake up in the morning and smile. Just smile for no particular reason except the fact that you are here. As days go by I feel myself growing closer and closer and my heart is suddenly coming out of its shy spot and wanting to feel what it feels like to be loved again. I don't ever want to lose this feeling. I don't ever want to lose you.you give me comfort and joy. The sound of your voice is like my favorite love song, I can listen to it all night until it puts me to sleep. Yet, still as I continue to lay here and think about everything you are to me, I can't help but wonder, what's on your mind too? How much do you feel, and how real do you think this really is? Still, I just want you to know that wherever this road may take us, and how far it may be to finally get where we want to go, always know you are in my heart and in my heart is where you'll always be. Life hasn't been this grateful to me, until there was you.
Thank you for being you. What I'd like to say next, I'd like to say to you personally. Until then.... 




Honey do you know that life can be cruel but when it all comes together there is no moment as sweet. That is how I feel about you entering my life. You have rekindled the flame called love in me I Love you




My red heart is blue, because I'm missing you. Every day, I think about you, and I imagine how great every hour, every minute, and every second would be if am there with you. Every night, when I lie in bed, I dream that you're beside me, holding me close to you. If you were, I'd whisper in your ear, how much I love you. Since you came into my life nothing has been the same.Honey It's the end of the day and I was thinking about you, as usual. I want you to know how much I sincerely love the times we've spent talking. It means so much to me. It truly seems like I've known you forever and I honestly can't imagine life without you now. There will be no looking back, no second thoughts and no regrets. I want you and need only you ... and that love will only grow stronger. Do not be scared my love. Sometimes life hits you with unexpected things that take you totally by surprise. All I can say is you're the best surprise life has given me and your capacity for love, caring, and understanding never ceases to amaze me. I've truly been blessed by finding you and I'll never let you go even if I have to bring Back to You in my joy I've experienced love to its fullest, and I've tasted a beauty that never ends, because you're where my happiness begins. I'm incomplete without you, and I'll never stop loving you. You're the world to me, in brilliant colors. You're my best friend,
a favorite song that will never end.
And together is where we should be.
Someday soon, I pray, that you'll walk through the door and take this heartache away Honey 





Hello Honey i Really Missed you alot here Hope you are doing fine and i think that there is no problem because i did not see you online dear where have you been and what is happened Dear i will lIKE To know Dear.........You're always lighting up my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my baby, and will forever be my baby. You will always be the love of my life, and please never give up, always have faith in yourself and you will gain the greatest gift of all, the gift of hope and love you righteously deserve. Every time I think of you my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together we grow closer. I'm simply hanging by a moment, waiting to see you so you can hold me so tight that all else fades, I thought after you left you would fade away from my mind, but still everyday I wake up dreaming of our time chatting together. I will never forget you. I hope you still think of me too. I love you with all that I am, all that I was and all that I will ever be. Please know that my love and I are inseparable and I would want it no other way and if time could express my love for you then it's forever and a day, I can't wait to be with you, see your smile, look in your eyes, feel your sweet touch, hear your perfect words and kiss your perfect lips. The way I feel about you some people call it crazy, some call it insane, but I call it true love. I really love you dear .




As time goes on and we're apart, I think of how things could have been. What we could have said or done to work things through. I would have been more understanding and not so judgmental, more loving and not so hurtful. I would have told you I loved and cherished you more often. That there can never or will ever be another person who I admire like you or who has reached the depths of my heart like you have. I would have told you that I'm so very proud of how far you've come and the things you have accomplished. But how could I find the words or actions to explain to you just how much I love you. It would take a million lifetimes to even comprehend my feelings. I would have told you that you took my breath away the first time I saw your picture. I would have told you that you made me believe in love the first time you told me you love  or stole my heart the moment you uttered those magical words. I would have told you that every time I looked into your eyes in your picture I saw my destiny. My one and only. My soul mate, my best friend, my lover, my husband, my inspiration, and the father of my children.  I would have told you that my knees and entire body would shake every time you looked deep down into me with your eyes. And made me feel like you could read my mind and soul. Life just isn't life without you in my life . I Love you and i cant wait to be in your arms anymore to feel your loving arms around me to make me whole and completed as well .


Your Heart Queen Monica 




You 've got me dreaming about you. Thoughts of you invade my mind every second of every day. I can't help it; you have become a part of my world and it scares me because I haven't depended on anyone in a long time. I would trust you with everything .... I do trust you with everything I am and I pray to God that you never do anything to make me regret it. Yes, now I can honestly say that I love you and will always love you because you got past my defenses and made it to that special place located at the core of my soul. You say that we were meant for each other and to be totally honest I was a little skeptical at first, but now I know that you love me .



I am so glad to be loved by someone very special like you. I thought all along that nobody can ever make me happy and win my hardened heart until I met you. You've really charged my life and I thank God I am loved and cherished by someone like you. If I come back to this world again I would like to meet you again where we can share the wonderful love we've started. I love you so much, my love. You mean more than anything in this world to me. Thank God I found you at last. You are my everything. 





In life, we receive a wonderful opportunity, and that is to love. Love comes in many forms. You love people in different ways and for different reasons, depending upon how they have touched your life. Love is a very powerful word and can describe a multitude of feelings, but its main context carries the same meaning.


I want to tell you that the love I have for you is undying. It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together. I want to lie next to you at night and fall asleep in your arms, only to wake to your beautiful smile. I want to share in your joys and sorrows. I want to be your everything. You are everything to me.


You are everything I do. You see and bring out the best in me. You are the one I want to share everything with - my thoughts, hopes and dreams. Thinking of you makes my heart feel full. You are such a source of inspiration for me. I will forever be indebted to you for all you have brought to my life. So, to repay you, I promise you my heart and all the love in it for the rest of my life....
