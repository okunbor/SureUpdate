Hello, it's nice hearing from u, first to start with, My name is kingsley Moris and I'm kind of new to this whole ... thing so i really don't know if it works, presently im single and ready to mingle with the right guy that comes my way, i would like for u to know that i am not up here in search for a sex partner, i am in search of a girl that is real, a guy that would love me for me and a girl that is ready to take up to his responsibilities, i am saying this becos i have been badly treated in the past, so right now if i must go into any relationship, it must be a long lasting one that would lead to marriage,well my hobbies are reading swimming, horse racing, clubbing, and bike racing. Well i think that is all i gat to say for now, until when next i hear from u.take care of ur self and God bless, I do have more pics.

How are u doing i hope u are great......Anyway i got ur message and i really had fun in reading. I must confess you really sound so nice, let me tell u pretty about myself and at the same time i would love to know more about u. Well I'm searching for someone who shares the following qualities with me. Thoughtful, loving, goal oriented, along with sense of humor. I love to laugh and smile. I also love to read, cook, and travel. My interests are many. I am honest, intelligent, loyal,affectionate, easy going, romantic, soft-spoken and sensual. I'm romantic, caring, and much more! I'm "crazy" about all pets. especially dogs and cats. I love nature and I like to travel. I like books and reading Bible .I'm looking for a partner for life...are you the one?? Appearance is important ,if you are so similar wouldn't that be kind of boring? Everyone needs their own interests, likes/dislikes, hobbies, views, etc because its these things that make us unique,It's hard to put down in words what you think you may be looking for in someone; because sometimes you don't know what you're looking for until you stumble across it in the dark and stub your toes on it. Obviously you want to meet someone who has similar interests, hobbies, views, etc so there is some compatibility. Yet, on the other hand, if i am looking for a man i can share my life with, the men who is really himself and don't really make thing hard, i will love to meet honest, caring, lovely, trust worthy man and who is one woman . the man i can share laughter, joke, fun , love , understanding with , i am also looking for romantic man who can make me feel the taste. Who is God Fearing, I'm open minded, Straight forward, Down to earth..and lots more. I also want you to know that I'm not presently in the state at the moment and would be back pretty soon. I hope to back back soon cos right now I'm trying to put things right. I hope you would be online soon so that we could talk more better.
Take care
Kingsley

Hey, how are u and how did ur day go? i hope u had fun? thanks for getting back at me. Well lil more about me, I was born and lived eventually all my life in Florida, I have a Bachelor? degree in finance from Florida Gulf Coast University and presently working at Florida Hilton Hotels in Florida, as the purchasing manager.. I relocated back here because things became hard for me in Florida.. I am was pretty ok with my work although its a bit stressful, so far it pays the bills and put food on the table, Well i am a fun loving type and i enjoy life to the fullest. Concerning my love life, i have been badly treated in my past dates and would not wanna talk much about it as i intend dropping the past behind me and facing the future.. I knew all i put in for my past relationship but still yet i got the whole blame and was dumped after i told him he was cheatin and playing games on me.. Anyway that would not be neccessary for now cos i intend knowing more about you. My dad is a Native American and while my mum is partly an African America but based in the states virtually all her life., Well my folks separated when i was a kid and ever since then, mom moved down to Africa with my Baby sister Camie and i lost my dad when i was 20 years. I'm presently out of the states at the moment, I'm in Nigeria right now. I came over
