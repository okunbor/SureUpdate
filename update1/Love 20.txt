You are the treasure that I seek, you were so close i didn't know, the love that see for so many year was right beside me i couldn't feel it..When i look at the clouds i see you coming to me.i didn't know was a horse galloping...to each other. When the breeze of love blowing you to me my love..i thought was a never ending love..but when you left me i cried..i wish i could hold you close..once again to my arms...you know how crazy i am about you i guess i was not thinking...come back to me babe you all i have left..Multiply my love for you by infinity, take it to the depths of forever and you'll still only have a glimpse of how much I love you." "Why do I love you? Because you are and always have been my dream. Even though were far apart I love you dearly with all my heart. If enduring pain, braving shame, despising one's self for the sake of affection and accepting misery without question is the definition of love - then, I LOVE YOU.I love you more than any word can say ... I love you more than every action I take ... I'll be right here loving you till the end
