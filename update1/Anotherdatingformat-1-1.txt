About my family its a long story to tell and touching that make me share tears whenever i remembered the past and what makes me join this lifestyle.. My parents are native of America,  my parent are into partnership business, they  sell interior decoration in USA and West African countries . My goals and dreams are to live a good life,and maybe meet someone that believes in unconditional love. I've got a great sense of humor,I am more conservative politically than liberal...i know how to have fun, and how to make my man feel great when we are in bed. I am from a family of only me from my parent. Unfortunately i lost my Father by  an heart attack and my mum in  an auto accident and left me all alone,since my parent death i have started to live my life by myself and not depending on my family, although i still miss my Dad and mom because of the courage and advises they both  give to me  about life , Soon after my parent death, there live a man in my area, he was the one who brought me up to train me to become a sub/slave girl. I served this man and was released after few years to continue my life. Soon after i met my second master online and he relocate me from Colorado  to him in Texas,he was 57 years old,  i continue my life with this man, i signed a lifetime contract with him, we both love each other and he really cared for me, but very painful death do us apart two years ago.

So after his death,  i had to,move to Maine to live my life all alone. I have an uncle here, and i live with a roommate. Since no one to call a man in my life again, during this period the young guys have been meeting all was sheet on me that why i decided to take my time to  find another older man that i will spend al the rest of my life with. I have to come on ALT maybe i can find what i seek and i am happy i think i got you if that you are truly serious.Like what my father do say it better you try and fail than not to try all,so i decided to give myself a chance again. 

Am here looking for a man that i will serve and will be able to listen to me , communicate his feelings to me , make me laugh, hold and comfort me in need,stand by my side, respect me, passionate lover in every way, support me in every way, love me and only me, make me smile, protect me when needed, romantic time to time ,constantly relative, and treat me right.......that all about my bad story but i know i will surely laugh one day and i know God will surlly make me laugh one day. So please i will be glad to know if you truly want me. I attach some of my pics

I am real easy person to talk to and a good listener. my motto in life is "Life is to be Enjoyed" but in reality i can't really enjoy life by myself as i would love to have someone to share and enjoy life with me., I like going to the movies(Cinemas), or watching movies in my room, I like camping, fishing swimming, listening to music and dance to any kind of music, traveling, going bowling and also a good cook I can make crepes, pasta and anything from scrape and my favorite are chips with chicken, shrimp, crab and rice. I also am looking for someone to share the rest of my life & grow old with! I have a great sence of humor.....I'm a Romantic at Heart I figure I'll treat people how I WANT to be treated.  I'm the kind of woman who's curtious, I give 100% attention for the right man, being a one man woman, say the word thankyou..... I would like to be a Wife & a Mother also......& reading this letter should tell you about my character.....................
I want a real relationship whcih will lead to marriage and  to be like no other you have ever shared in or experienced. This relationship I want to build with you will be filled with substance, quality, spirituality and potential.
 I know that there is no barrier too great for God, when He chooses to bring two people together; I am at a point in my life where I would always be honest with the chosen one, and be there with the one God has for me 24/7.
Well I'll bring this letter to a close........Thanks for taking the time for coming on this sight.....I just want you to know the WHOLE story about me....ask me anything & I'll answer it truthfully.....a realationship isn't nothing without trust....I will be earnestl waiting for your letter!

Phyllis





We Have Alot In Common
=========================
Hi ,
Thank you so much for getting back in touch with me as it actually made my day!!!, you sound like all i want , you are my perfect match . I am really going to put a lot of effort into writing this letter to you in hopes it will provide you with a good understanding of who I am, what I am all about, and what has made me the person I am today. The reason I am going to write a letter rather than just send a message is because I am serious about wanting to establish a quality friendship with you, and because of the fact I rarely contact anyone on here, so when I do you can be rest assured I am serious about my intentions. Am looking for a man that will be able to listen to me , communicate his feelings to me , make me laugh, hold and comfort me in need,stand by my side, respect me, passionate lover in every way, support me in everyway, love me and only me, make me smile, protect me when needed, romantic time to time ,constantly reative, and treat me right.... I know you will think what is a pretty lady like me doing on here .. Yes the reason I came on to the internet to find the special person who deserves all the love and passion that makes up my heart and soul is because I do not have the time to meet others out in a public setting, and the fact I feel you can learn so much about someone through letters, as a person has to take there time and think about the words they want to express, so it allows you to gain a better understanding of someone than you would probably otherwise. Dear The very reason I am interested in establishing a friendship with you is because I feel I have alot to offer you in the way of a friendship and I know I have alot to share with you that will be of interest to you and even some things that will surprise you. I am very much a woman of substance and I am very unique in todays society because I live my life through my spirituality and through the word of God and because I have such a strong understanding of what I feel my role in life is suppose to be. I am a woman of integrity and my word is my honor!. I have very high standards for myself and my life is all about providing love, peace and happiness to others.For you to get a better understanding of me picture a waterfall in your mind and instead of all the water overflowing it is all the love and passion I have in my heart to give to others who are deserving, as the love and passion has an endless flow coming out of my heart. Where others write many people and keep there messages short because they are all about how many they can write, I am the opposite and very selective in whom I choose to write and I like to give them my very best even if it is in a long letter such as this. I know the type of person who I want to build a friendship with so I am willing to put the time and effort in my messages to show that to you.
I look forward to hearing from you with anticipation.
"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." Jer 29:11 (NIV)
Warmest Thoughts,
Timi.

To A Beautiful King!
======================
I just want you to know that I very much appreciated receiving your letter every moment i check my mail. You are a very special person who I SERIOUSLY want to explore the possibility of building a long term friendship with, that will in time turn into a marriage and family. That is my dream, and I hope to make it come true with you!. In my heart I feel you have all the qualities it takes to make me very happy... About my past relationship, I was cheated on, My Ex cheated on me and i just have to let go...Its happend one saturday morning, i was to travel for a bussiness trip to Illinois in chicago, and he droped me at the airport and left...But suddenly i couldnt make my flight that day cause, my flight was re scheduled to be the next saturday and i have to go back home, to get him informed that flight was re-scheduled....Getting to his place, i couldnt find Him in the sitting room so i have to check him in his living room, on getting there...I couldnt stand what i saw!!! I CAUGHT HIM MAKING LOVE TO MY BEST FRIEND, All was mad and crazy, dont know what to say or to do..So i just started crying and he was trying to make me understand that its the work of Devil and not his intension, and ever since then i was single, I was lonely and far from sex for 2 years plus till date. My reasoning which I understand is very strange in today's world, but my belief is my heart and soul, and the passion that is in it is very unique and special, so I made the decision and made a promise to God that I would not be sexually active for the sake of just wanting sex, or to have sex for someone elses own self gratification. Knowing the passion that is contained in my heart and soul is very unique, I made the decision to abstain from sex because I want this special gift to be shared with the person I am dedicating the rest of my life to, as his Wife and the mother of his children ... It is very important for me to build a life of stability, security, and opportunity for the special person I hope to share my thoughts, feelings, experiences, dreams and fantasies with, and to offer the best in opportunities for any children that might be included in my life and that is my focus at this time and I also do enjoy my job. Professionally, i have once been an accountant before facing the carier i have always prayed for .I do travel outside of the States to buy Art Sculptures , craft , beeds etc and ship it into the States for sales. this have make me travel alot , i have been to different Europian countries ,twice in Australia,once in Finland,Italy and this is my first time in the western part of Africa( Nigeria) for a special shopping for some latest Art Sculptures . Honey in me you are going to find a woman that was blessed with an over abundance of passion to give to the ones I share my heart and soul with. For you to really know me you will have to experience me, as the love that makes up my heart is like a waterfall, where the water never stops flowing down. In this case my heart is the waterfall, and the love and passion that flows endlessly is representing the water. I am a very unique person for many reasons, but one of those is the fact that I can never get enough of romancing that special someone. Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to build this special friendship with you!. You will be rewarded for it through the passionate love that makes up my heart and soul!. I am so excited to be able to do what I do best and that is romance you with all the passion that makes up my heart and soul!. My special friendship with you is something I want to make permanent and eventually build into a family to call our very own! Directly from my heart to yours! Your Future Queen! (I hope!) Timi.

Will You Be My King
=====================
Am happy you are interested in learning more about me ,I have never dealt with anyone in the service , i have been single for 2 years like i have told you in my last mail to you, because am yet to find that special one to share my life with , I am presently in Africa(Nigeria ),is not just a visit ,am here on business trip, am here to buy gold,sculptures and some paintings , it is cheaper down here compared to other part fo the world, I inherited this business from my late father, it has been an interesting business.My goals and dreams are to live a good life,and maybe meet someone that believes in unconditional love.I've got a great sense of humor,I am more conservative politically than liberal...I work hard, and know how to have fun.. About my family its a long story to tell and touching that make me share tears whenever i remembered the past.I will keep this short,i came out from a good combination of two,my Mom is from UK while Dad is a native of America.I am the one and only child of my parent, i dont know much about my Moms family in the UK while my Dads part is very small...Unfortunatly i lost my Father by car accident, this happened about 3 years ago, and didnt grew up to know whom my mum was, since my father's death i have started to live my life by myself and not depending on my family, although i still miss my Dad because of the courage and advises he give to me about life , but i am glad i am whom i am today. I could remember when my late father was alive, my Mum's Cousin do come to us in the state for visit but after the final burial of my father, they decided to raise me some fund to stand on my own then left for UK, and for me to continue with my life carrier....I will count my family to be one of the royal family, due to what Dad told me, when my mom and dad where alive they do treat each other in a manner of my King and my Queen , while i am the Princess. I can cook pretty good... I like a good wine. I've been working out more regularily than I had been, and eat healthy food...I don't do drugs, and I like who I am..Although I think a terrific man would bring out the best in me...I'm a believer in God who pray every blessed day , am a catholic , i do go to church weekly, and try to do the right things every day...I don't worry about what people think of me...I know how to treat a man well still yet i was betrayed by my own best friend dating my Ex Boyfriend... You are really amazing.Inside of me there is a place where my sweetest dreams reside, where my highest hopes are kept alive, where my deepest feelings are felt and where my favorite memories are safe and warm. I find that you're on my mind more often than any other thought. Sometimes I bring you there purposely just to make my day brighter. But more often, you surprise me and find your own way into mythoughts.There are even times when I awaken, I realize that you've been a part of my dreams. Then during the day, when my imagination is free to run, it takes me into your arms and allows me to linger there knowing there's nothing I'd rather do. I know my thoughts are only reflecting the loving hopes of my heart because whenever they wander, they always take me to you. Only the most special things in my world get to come inside my heart and stay. And now, I realize how deeply my life has been touched by you. I miss you. Timi.

My Soldier Of Mercy
====================
Sweetheart your letter keeps chilling me up with hopes and thoughs of a future plans .At this very moment I am sitting here dreaming and fantasizing about how nice it would be for you to be near, where I could do what I enjoy most and that is being able to romance the special one I have in my life... In me sweetheart you are going to find the most passionate, loving and romantic woman you have ever met. There are very few promises in life but this is one of them!. ROMANCE is the key to my happiness and to my heart and soul!. 




The single biggest reason I am single today is because I am yet to find a man who will romance me with the passion of his heart and be a giver of his love, and not just a taker. I am a woman who is very committed to the special man I am sharing my heart and soul with. I totally dedicate and devote my life totally to this person 24/7, for he is my King and it is my belief that as long as he is my King, God would want me to treat him as such, by putting him on a pedestal that is reserved only for a King and showing him with an endless amount of affection, attention, passion, and unconditional love. It is my duty as a follower of the word of God to be his provider, providing for his emotional, mental, and sexual needs. It is my responsibility as his Queen to take any problems and stress that he has in his life and put it on my shoulders to free him of it, for I am a woman and his Queen!. My shoulders are bigger so it is my obligation to carry the burdens he has in life on them, allowing him to have a healthy mind, body, and heart and soul at all times. I love and cherish this role sweetheart, and it is because I love it so much, that I feel God has a role for everyone in life, and his chosen role for me is to be a excellent wife, mother, and family woman, because of the way I live my life, and because of my passion to be a great lover and family woman, in addition to the passion I have for children. I believe children play a big part in my life. Sweetheart i am almost through with my business here all i need to do now is to get my goods shipped first thing on monday and I will be flying out of here back home by Wednesday. Dear you are really going to be in for a big surprise as you get to know and understand me as my words mean nothing compared to my action. Your Angel Of Mercy Timi.

You've Captured My Heart
=========================
My Soldier of Mercy, Hi sweetie! I didn't have the courage to approach you in person because of the distance between us, so I hope you consider my letter. I have so much inside my heart that it keeps me from breathing sometimes. I know we just met but these feelings that I have for you keep growing and growing every day. Now that I am in love with you, I sleep, thinking about you and the next morning I wake up smiling. It's amazing how you got me and trapped me, melt me and mold me to your taste. I never thought I could love this much but I was so wrong. I just thank God for having you. We are meant for each other and no one can change that. I love you with ALL my heart. Love always, Your Angel of Mercy. Timi

My Heart's Reconsideration
=========================
My King, Perhaps you will be astonished for receiving a letter from me. I just want you to know that a letter is more eloquent than words. That is why this will definitely speak for itself. I am a little bit confused on how and what to do just to eradicate you to know from my vivid mind your charming and beautiful face. The more time I spend with you the more I like everything about you and the more I want to find out all about you - how you think, how you feel, what your dreams are and everything nice from you. If I could only do something just to persuade you. Sweetie every thing I wish to do was left undone because of this unexplainable emotion. My admiration was still bubbling within me these past lonely days. Truthfully, and undoubtedly, I can fool anyone but I cannot fool myself. I would be a great liar if I uttered that I'm not in love with you. No matter what you think or say, all I can say is; I really love you with all my heart and I will not hesitate if you will give me just a little time to prove my feelings of endearment and to prove to you that I'm deserving of your feelings, from your heart. My dearly beloved, you became so honorable in my eyes, like a precious gem, counted with extremely good intellectual reasoning makes me emotionally struck and speechless. I am very serious now in telling you that I can no longer endure such extreme anxiety and sleepless nights that I am experiencing right of this moment. Since the first day i read from you.... I felt I was living in a new and wonderful world, full of love. And the sun is brighter, the pastures became greener and everything I do was magnificent. You should inculcate and instill in your mind that "I cherish you so much". Such love, like everything, deserves to be given much attention and care in order to grow more and more. Love always, Your Queen. Timi.
 

Love Assured
====================
Hi, Baby, you're always lighting up my heart with the things you say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my baby, and will forever be my baby.

I feel safe to be myself knowing I can not be perfect and you will continue to love me.Thank you for the time you take to write me and telling me I am wonderful ...Those silent moments recharge my senses of appreciation for you.Thank you for written me at the right time... it shows me that you are genuinely supportive of my goals, which are such a part of who I am.Thank you for answering all my questions without criticism or impatience - you have shown me that my dream of a kind and considerate relationship is a reality. You motive me to expect and tolerate no less and to be the same with you and those around me. You have created calmness and safety in my life which I only ever imagined. Every time I think of you my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment i read from you we grow closer. I'm simply hanging by a moment, waiting to see you so you can hold me so tight that all else fades; I thought upon the distance between us the feelings we had will fade away from my mind, but still everyday I wake up dreaming of our time together. I will never forget you. I hope you still think of me too. I love you with all that I am, all that I was and all that I will ever be. Please know that my love and I are inseparable and I would want it no other way and if time could express my love for you then it's forever and a day. I can't wait to be with you, see your smile, look in your eyes, feel your sweet touch, hear your perfect words and kiss your perfect lips. The way I feel about you some people call it crazy, some call it insane, but I call it true love. I really love you, Baby Bear. I love you and only you and want you and only you - I could never have even imagined or wished for such a blessing when it comes to you and me being together and how lucky we are to be in love. ..........., Honey, I love you so very much and I hope this reassures you. Love Always, Your Angel of Mercy. Timi.

Describing True Feelings
==================================
My Prince, I am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are one of the best things that has happened in my life, and I don't regret being with you this way..I know I am missing alot not being there with you today ... I cant wait to meet your Family for a special introduction... Its going to be lovely cuddle up with you for more than a week . I have been through relationships, but none work out.am . But you happened, you came into my life and stole my heart from the day I saw your profile... At first I was confused, didn't really know what I wanted, I didn't know if I would want to take a chance again and actually take you seriously. So, I decided to come close to you as a friend and find out who you truly were and what you were like. You seemed cool, nice and funny some things I really liked in a guy. So I took a chance and got with you. Babe,from the beginning, things seems well, I actually had no doubt about you.I know for sure you are actually taking me seriously. Before I know I had already fallen for you . Well, time has passed and I have discovered new things and a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, in a way, I'm scared 'cause I am actually growing a true feeling inside my heart which I just cant explain, but I know it's there waiting for you to come and uncover it. I truly don't know what your feelings are but I don't want to force you in telling me what you don't feel towards me. I would want to receive love and trust from you when you truly mean it. All I ask from you is to show me you care and not hide anything, to also have trust in me the way I do in you. Love always, Your Princess. Timi.

        ***  You are my everything. Thank you for loving me the way no one can. You understand me and you know just how to make things right. You will never know just how much I love you, but I will spend the rest of my days trying to show you. You saved me from the worst, and you are always there for me. Fighting is never an option and making love is always as sweet as the first time. No matter what, there will never be another for me and I will always keep you safe. I love you for all eternity. Again, thank you, Baby.



   

        *** Baby, I can't begin to explain how you have enriched my life. I sit and think that it is so hard to believe that just a few days ago we were two lonely dreamers in a chat room. I knew from the first moment I chatted with you I loved you. And, when I will be meeting you I know I would forever be by your side -- forever your partner and forever your love. And, now forever your wife. I know I don't express it nearly as often as I should, but baby, don't doubt me. I love you more now than I ever thought possible. And that love grows each and every day. Every time you smile, speak, and every time you have that look in your eyes. I am yours, you hold my heart. I love you, and thank you for making me the luckiest woman on earth.

Love Eternally,




   
           *** Hey Honey, I just wanted to do something simple to say I love you and to put that smile I would love so much on your face. I want everyone to know how much you mean to me. Ever since you have entered my life, I've been flying on Cloud 9 and I have not come down yetm,I tell you this everyday, but you are the most outrageous person I know, inside and out and I see that more clearly with each passing day. I love everything about you, about us. You make me feel what i have never felt for anyone, you have made me so happy, the happiest I've ever been. You give me the most amazing feelings inside, the feeling of being in love with you.
  I still don't know what I did to be so lucky to have you in my life, my dream come true... I am so thankful though. In this short time that we've been together, we have grown so much and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. I want you,  with all my heart and soul, always and forever!

Love always,



            
        *** I was on my way to bed and wanted to write you a little note. Thank you so much for having so much faith in me and in us as a couple. Thank you for making me a better person, and for giving your heart to me and opening up so much.Over the last few days, it's been wonderful; I never expected to feel this way nor actually to meet you in this way, experiencing life with you. You are wonderful ... to me, . You make me really happy and even though we are apart so much of the time, it's made up each time I see you again. The feeling that I get is overwhelming every time that I do get to see you for the first time in such a long time and as time goes by my feelings for you grow dramatically.I was thinking so much about that earlier tonight, when I am going to meet you at the airport. I am getting butterflies in my stomach just at the thought of seeing you again. You make everything complete and I can't imagine spending time with someone else and having these feelings for anyone else. I'm anxious to see you . Time is ticking, and it's going by really slow.It takes a strong man to accomplish everything that you have in your life, I am proud of you that you stick to your goals, you have improved your life so much from what it was before and I am so happy that you respect my beliefs as I respect yours. You say that you are going to make me a happy woman ... well, you have already done that, just by being you and showing me love and being so open with your feelings. You are what I dreamed of when I was a little girl, someone with integrity, honesty, love, affection, handsome, and with such a charming personality. I never thought I would find you, but here you are.I love you so much, and can't wait to be with you again. I want to give you my heart and soul. I don't care about anything else in the world because I am in love with you. I love you. Thank you ........, for you have made all of my dreams come true. I could not ask for more. I am the luckiest girl in the world to be called your woman..I'm truly honored. Thank you.

Love always,




    

         *** Hey, Baby, I know we haven't been dating that long, but I want you to know that I love you from the bottom of my heart. From the moment I first met you, I knew that I wanted you in my life, whether as a friend or something a little more. Baby, I prayed for a long time to find someone like you. Someone willing to fight for me, someone to make me smile and someone who I know truly loves me. You're in my thoughts, my dreams, and every breath I take.I know truly that this is love. I feel like I can tell you anything. I may not always want to, but you know things about me that even my best friend doesn't know. You're always there to pick me up when I fall, and to dry my tears. Thank you, Baby. I love you.
Love always and forever




 

             *** When I get there with you,I will feel alive. You bring to me a happiness that no one else ever could. You bring to me a love I have never known before. I could not imagine what my life would be like without you. You have touched my heart in ways no one could ever comprehend. I will love being with you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.Every day I wake up thanking God for you. You have given me so much, and I don't know if I will be able to give back all that you have given me. You have been my guiding light when I was lost. You have been my comforter through all my trials and sorrow. You have been my rock.I want to tell you that the love I have for you is undying. It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together. I want to lie next to you at night and fall asleep in your arms. I want to wake to your beautiful smile. I want to share in your joys and sorrows. I want to be your everything, because you are everything to me.I promise to always love you and always hold you in my heart. I will always be here for you when you need me, and I will love you no matter what life brings us. You are my soul mate, and I vow to love you all eternity. I love you, baby.
   Talk to you in the morning
Yours




         ***     I am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are one of the best things that has happened in my life, and I don't regret being with you.I have been through many relationships, but didn't really take them seriously. I was used and played by a guy who I really loved.I wasn't born a bitch, it's just a guy made me this way. Since then I have not taken chances with a guy. But you happened, you came into my life and stole my heart from the day i met you.
   At first I was confused, didn't really know what I wanted, I didn't know if I would want to take a chance again and actually take you seriously.

So I took a chance and got with you.In the beginning, things didn't seem that well, I actually had my doubts about you. I wasn't sure you were actually taking me seriously. But, it was too late to look back; I had already fallen for you since the day I met you and I wasn't really looking forward to giving up too soon. I tried so hard to have you, I wasn't going to let you go so easily!cos i wanna lay all my life on you.Well, time has passed and I have discovered new things and a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, in a way, I'm scared 'cause I am actually growing a true feeling inside my heart which I just cant explain, but I know it's there waiting for you to come and uncover it.

         ***I want you to know that since the day we met I've fallen deeply in love with you. There are no words to express the gratitude I feel in my heart that you came into my life, and how you make every day so special. You are my life, my heart, my soul. You are my best friend, my one true love, my one and only. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you more tomorrow than I do today. I've been trying to find a way to express my feelings for you. Ive always wanted to create something unique to show you just how much I love you. Now Ive found the right place, and Im going to tell the world that I LOVE YOU! It may sound crazy and corny, but I want to tell the whole universe about the true and sincere affection I have for you. I cannot tell you exactly how I feel, but I hope that you feel the warmth of my love whenever we are together. I will be right here beside you any time you need me, and I will be with you until I breathe my last breath. I promise to share my life with you no matter what tomorrow may bring.Always remember the good times weve had and how we bring out the best in each other. Stay in love, babe, and keep that tender, sweet smile on your face. Know that I will love you forever.


    Dear
  Thanks for being there when I needed a shoulder to lean on, for patiently listening to my personal problems. Baby, I just want you to know how happy am I to have you in my life and I thank God for that. Thank you for the love and the joy you bring. You've changed my life, Baby.You're the only man who gives my heart some excitement and thrills. When I'm with you I feel like I'm out of control! You taught me how to handle life seriously, you taught me how to solve my problems and to face it without any fear... when I'm with you, I feel no fear, not even a single one.I know that when you say you love me and I admit that I've fallen for you, I know that I wouldn't shed any tears from now on. I love you and that's what I want you to bear in your mind, and it's for keeps.
               Yours and only yours



   If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of this beautiful feeling that I have for you, I would have whispered them to you the first time we met. The best thing that I can do is to show you now.I love you so much, Sweetie. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. You are like the best poetry ever composed, the best song ever played, the best picture ever painted. I never thought that someone like me could get so lucky!I love you more than my life, more than my world. I love you more and more each day and that is the most wonderful feeling any man can ever hope to experience
    I met on you on a bright Sunday and at that point I didn't know exactly what you meant to me... now I do. You are the light in my eyes, the happiness in my heart, and just the thought of you leaving me breaks me into small and countless pieces.So, on a day like today, do we promise to love each other through good and bad, for better or worse, until death do as part. And though we are not yet married, I will never break that vow. Also, I know you won't because the day I met you was the day my life began.
    You, you, you and you alone... you shall reign in my heart. You are the one I desire without whom I could not be complete. I will live for you alone and I will work for you alone. I will share with you my thoughts, my heart, my mind and my body. I am waiting to receive you. I will never use force on you not even by words. In your presence, I will always be honest, transparent and sincere. I want always to be at your side... I love you
     .The way I feel for you amazes me daily. I have never loved before, not like this. Even after all this time, whenever you walk into the room, my heart still skips a beat. It is so comforting, to look across the room at you to find you looking at me, and somehow I know what you are thinking. This is a magical bond we share, and I treasure it in my heart.Your kisses, whether tender and gentle or rough and demanding, are consuming. Your touch is like fire and surprisingly, I find myself time and time again, completely surrendering to your love. For me, there is no control, not when it comes to how I feel about you. You are the world to me baby, and my world is brighter, since our paths have crossed.As we travel on our journey, hand-in-hand, there is no obstacle we can not get past. With you, I am strong. With you, I am happy. With you, life is good. I love you and want you beside me, always.
      Honey, you have changed my life completely. You're the one who makes me beautiful. You're the one who makes me strong. You're the one who makes me feel so important; you're everything to me.You show your love to me every day. I thank God that I have found a man like you. Please forgive me for not giving you enough time to chat with me, but I promise I will make up for it once we are together.All that I can offer you is a family. I can offer you a family that will stick together through the good and the bad. I can offer you a family that will support each other every day. Honey, that's all I can give...I hope thats what you want.I really wish that you were near me. I wish that I could just call your name when I needed you and that you would be there. However, knowing that you love me so much is enough for now, and if I can be your wife and a mother to your children, then I would wait forever to be with you. Ti amo tesoro mio. You're the only one that I want.
              I love you so very much sweetheart. You are the love of my life. I have a hard time explaining how I feel. I have never felt anything like this before. You are always there for me no matter what. I do not know what I would've done this week without your love and support. You are the most loving, caring, compassionate and absolutely most awesome guy that I have ever met. I never thought that was possible. I want to marry you now, I want to be your wife. I want a baby with you; that is the most awesome experience, nothing compares to that. I want you you to be a wonderful father to our kids, but you deserve more. Thank you for always being there, for your kind words,and the unconditional love. You are a dream come true and I want to spend the rest of my life with you as your wife, lover, and best friend. I have never in my life been so very happy. I feel much loved, beautiful and very happy.I'm so very proud of you. You are a very strong person. It is really cool that we are strong for each other in different ways. We totally understand each other and feel for each other. When you hurt, I hurt. When you are happy, I'm happy. I just love you so much sweetheart and I never want to lose you. I give you my heart, my love and my life for now and forever. I love you.
       Sometimes, I can't express to you the way I really feel inside. There are times I want to write poetry, or sing a song but they just say some of what my heart wants to tell you. I sat down today and decided to write you a letter. I am just an island girl who life is very different from yours ... because you are in a state miles away but our love will conquer all.You tell me to believe in our love and allow it to grow but sometimes it's so hard when you have so many doubts. You live in a city where the most beautiful women live and I am just one woman hundreds of miles away. It saddens my heart and sometimes I cry because I want to be with you and I don't know what to say or how to tell you what hurts me so deep inside. I know you are successful and I am so proud of you and for who you are, Sweetheart. But, like you, I will try and believe that our love will conquer all.I wrote you this letter to tell you how much I care, and if you ever needed me, Baby - please know I will be there. I may not be the most beautiful woman in the world but my heart is filled with gold. I know our friendship will continue to grow strong and we will conquer all obstacles placed between us. You make me feel so special and it overwhelms my heart to know there is a man who thinks highly of me. I will ask of you, to take it slow with me and let's grow in love, unity and respect. Miles separate us, but we have fun together and share similar interests and you have my back. So sweetheart I will try harder and never give up because I pray our love will conquer all.I am happy i am finally coming home to you.
       I am glad that finally, I have found someone like you. Now that I have you here with me, I would like to let you know how happy and grateful I am for you... every night I thank God for sending you to me. I may not tell you this as often as you expect me to, but trust me, I love you with all my heart and my soul. You mean so much to me.
It is you that I want to see waiting for me at the altar... it is also you that I want to hold my hand in the delivery room and it is you that I want to spend my life with. Now that we're together I promise to be always true to you, to love you and trust you. I love you more than anything this life can offer me.You made me realize that I don't need to wait for everybody's approval for anything... as long as I am happy and as long as it feels right for me. I guess destiny has lead you to me so I guess we're really meant for each other. Now I know everything's going to be okay because I have you with me now....

Love always
 


I got your message and it was quite fascinating and i want you to know that age does not matter to me and i hope it does not matter to you too i have always wanted to be with a man that will always make me happy for me and i believe an older man will suit that position in my life so i would say lets give this a try as i think we can both make this work out good....I was born and raised in NYC but presently in Africa i came down here with my parents before their death and ever since then i have been here alone and i am still here cos i have no one to go back to in the states thats why i am here looking for someone to love me and care for me till the end of time...I really like all you have said and the pictures you have sent and i hope that you make this work out good ...I am a woman with a good heart and if i find a man of the same cannibal i will be so happy and i am sure i will be the best woman to my man .Hope to hear again from you.
 
I am Honest Decent,Open Minded,Kind Hearted And Loving Caring and Trust worthy Down to earth to every one inlife,I'm a touchy-feely type of woman...I like to kiss and hug, and cuddle,but I won't smother you. I m  thoughtful, caring, clean,independant, fun, one man woman. Full of energy I like dancing to the oldies or country music, walking on the beach & boardwalk, going to the theatre, traveling, roller coasters, horseback riding, dining in or out,  or just working around the house. 

I enjoy spending time with the man in my life but also allow him free time for himself. I'm in a position to go anywhere, so distance is no problem. so reel me in so I don't get away.You'll have a good catch if you do.The key to my heart will be the man who wants to be close to me, holding hands, hugging, spending OUR time together doing the things we both like to do, I like seeing a good movie, working out, or just sitting at home nestled in front of a tv on a cold winter nite. A man with some energy, not a couch potato. He needs to be a well groomed, thoughtful, caring, a happy with himself man, that likes to talk as well as listen, who wants a  friend that leads to love, that accepts as well as gives. One who wants only one woman in his arms. I'll be faithfull to you, and there when you need an ear that listens. Kissing you when you least expect it, that kiss goodnite and another when you wake, and the big hug when needed most. Love me for me and I'll love you thru the ups and downs, till eternity
 
If money doesn't grow on trees,then why do banks have branches? why does a round pizza come in a square box? why don't glue stick to its bottle? why do u still call it a building when its already built? if its true that we r here to help others, what r others here 4? if u r not supposed to drink and drive, why do bars have parking space? we are a funny bunch of humans ** To those I have wronged ............. I sincerely appologise ........... To those I have helped ............ I wish I can do more .......... To those that have helped me ..........

Hello Natasha, how you doing? firstly i apologize for not getting back to you in time, i am very busy down here that why i could not email you, thank you for the Easter wishes and in your last message you said you are a little traditional, i want you to know that i am a kind of old fashion also and the idea to start as a friend is very nice and i will love that also, and as for you question i have been down here for the past 10 months and i got just two month left to spend down here, then i will be getting my ass back home, and when i get home i will be getting my retirement and start a new page of life with my woman, and as for my last name, i am originated from Poland, my dad is from Poland while my mom is from the united state, i am the only kid of my parent and i lost both of them in auto accident some years back....and here comes the third question, yes i have been alone since i lost my wife 6 years ago to heart failure. An Natasha i want you yo know that If it is meant to be, our hearts will find each other when we meet. And if our hearts melt together so will our bodies and souls. Then every word and every touch will fuel our passion flame. I will be yours, you will be mine, and we will be one...me finding you, chatting online, confessing my love, and then it happens all over again. The feelings that Ive felt for you all along begin to resurface. Only this time, I am free to act on them without fear of upsetting anyone..This feeling of being both scared and at peace, of having both butterflies and a sense of calm, is a feeling that I have only dreamed about. As the days continue to pass, my love for you continues to grow. I never thought I had the capacity to love anybody as much as I love you right now.A relationship is a two way street. It's never all your fault or the other persons. You go into the relationship together and work through it all together.Well l am happy to hear from you soon. So can you please tell me what kind of man are you looking for???Well can you please tell me if you can do all this for me?

I am a professional with an interesting and active life, both physically and intellectually. I am pretty easy-going, yet focused and persistent when it matters. I am a good problem-solver, and my thinking tends to be unconventional. I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities, such as hiking, gardening, going for a walk, swimming and camping . I enjoy art movies, good live music, and I read quite a bit.

You are a balanced and happy person, content with your life and your work. You have a sense of humor, are smart, self-confident, independent, educated, sophisticated, professional, independent and attractive in your own way. In a sense you don't need me to be happy. Critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, and artistic pursuits are definitely a turn-on. Maybe you share my sense of not quite fitting into mainstream culture, maybe because you lived abroad, identify with an ethnic minority group, or are just full of ideas of how to make this a better society. In short, I am looking for a classy lady who has experienced life on her own. You like to travel, you enjoy the outdoors, but like the cultural life of the city as well. 

Alright, maybe I am a bit demanding, but I only live once so why not get it right this time? I may be a discriminating dater and may come across as reserved and introverted at first, but once I made a commitment I am very loyal. In a sense, you don't need me. But it would be nice to come home to someone with whom you can unwind, share the experiences of your day, a nice dinner, and love and affection.
