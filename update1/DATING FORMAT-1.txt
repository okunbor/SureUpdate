 I have been married for the last 27 years and am now finding myself single again. I am so new at this. I have no idea exactly what it is I am looking for but can share with you some of the things I would hope for and that you should know about me.



Never take someone's feeling for granted because you never know how much courage they took to show it to you!

>I am a very passionate, honest, compassionate, dependable, kind, happy, caring, giving, sensitive (not over sensitive), positive and affectionate individual and I enjoy the most simple things in life the best. You should know I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve so you usually will not have to guess what I am thinking. It has shown to be a blessing and a curse for me at times. I believe in Karma so I try very hard to treat everyone like I hope to be treated. I know typically women tend to expect material things such as flowers, diamonds and poetry as an example. With me I am ok with you doing the things you want to just because that is what you
want to do not doing the things you think I expect you to do. I would rather spend some quality time with you sharing thoughts, conversation, kissing or heck we could go fishing.... just knowing you wanted to spend that time with me would be perfect. Along with being yourself I would want you to know you could talk with me about anything at all. I love to listen and I give the best hugs in the world if you need one. When you need me to be supportive and strong I will be there always and you need to know I have a soft, sweet and tender side that is very loving and sensual.
>
>I really enjoy writing, traveling, camping, rafting, shooting, 4 wheeling (not afraid to get dirty), movies (going out for one or staying in cuddled up watching at home on the couch), dancing (I love any kind of music I can dance to: The hardest of Rock to very slow dancing R&B), live music,BBQ's,drinking/learning about fine wines and high end Tequila's, friends and family, going on road trips (short and long) and enjoying a great storm at the beach. Hey with me you can be spontaneous. Nothing better then to take a ride somewhere beautiful and take pictures, have a picnic take time to stop and enjoy the beauty. Maybe stay and gaze at the stars or we can just get up and just do as we decide while we are going... If we ended up at the beach sitting in the rain watching the storms I would love it.
>
>Being a Realtor these days keeps me plenty busy but I really love the challenge of what I do. Believe me right now it can be challenging. But I always try and pull something positive out of it and learn something new each and every day. Sometimes they are just lessons... but it is still something learned.
>
>I am looking to meet someone who wants a best friend as well as a close & permanent relationship. Someone that can let me be who I am and they can be totally who they are. You have to be willing to have a
conversation and be able to hear someone else's opinion as well. I am not into drama, won't cause any and don't want to be a part of any. Myself, I don't ask for much and I am very easy to get along with. Just want someone who is real and willing to accept someone who is the same. Just know that if something is important to you and you want to share it with me then it will be important to me too I will listen and or you can show me...please share.
>
>I appreciate you stopping by and checking out my profile. Good luck to you and I hope you find what it is you are looking for.
>
>Lisa
>
>PS: FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT IM ME PLEASE DO NOT GET OFFENDED IF I DO NOT RESPOND. A LOT OF TIMES I AM CHECKING POF FROM MY CELL AND I AM NOT ABLE TO SEE THAT YOU ARE SENDING ME AN IM. I HAVE HAD SOME VERY NASTY NOTES FROM THOSE WHO THOUGHT I WAS IGNORING THEM. TAKE CARE AND ENJOY YOUR DAY...
>First Date
>I think meeting somewhere casual would be great so no
one felt pressured. Sit and get to know each other a bit. Be ready to laugh and smile. Just be who you are. That's how I am. I am not looking for a one night stand!!!

>Ever since you walked into my life I have been smiling. There hasn't been a night when I have gone to sleep with a frown on my face, and it's all because of you. Honey, I am glad that you came into my life. I have always wanted the love of my life to be understanding, loving, caring, and faithful. I wanted someone who would accept
me for who I am. I know that I’ve found that person in you.  I didn't have to think twice when you asked me to be your wife. I knew that you were the perfect match for me. I don't think that there is, or that there ever could be, anyone better than you out there for me.

>I love you with my whole heart. I have never trusted anyone the way I trust you. Sometimes I even doubt myself, but I know I will never doubt you because you are my true love. I know deep down inside that you will never break my heart or let me down in any way.
>Thank you for everything, honey. I pray to God every day to bless you with everything you deserve. I will love you until the end of time.
>
>
>Though the miles separate us, the bond we have is far stronger. You are the very one I have spent all these years looking for. You make me smile. You make me laugh. You make me whole. I can not describe the giddy feeling I have when you are here or even when you
cross my mind. I am so amazingly happy and content and forever I want to stay in your life, in your world, in your family, and in your arms.  what day
>Love always,
>
>Dear Love, I know we don't get to talk or see each other much. But being apart for now doesn't change the way I feel about you in my heart. Sure I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed with this emptiness in my chest. But, just remember that I love you and everything about you.
>That's what gets me through every minute of every day that I'm without you. Sweetheart, you don't know what I would give to kiss your lips, feel your touch, or even just to see you. I long to hold you and feel your sweet caress. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.
>You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe, but more importantly, you make me feel wanted. We both knew our friendship would grow right from the very first day we spoke. But, neither one of us could begin to imagine the
love we both feel, not exploding or thundering into our hearts, but just slowly growing into a beautiful relationship that only you and I can understand. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, and my love. just as long as you remember that I love you with every aching bone in my body no matter what. Having your love has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't care what others say about you and me. All I know is that I love you, and that will never change.
>Love always
>
>how are you doing today i hope all is well with you. Since i met you my soul feels glad, if you not the one why does my hand feel yours this way, if you are not my why does your heart return my calls, i believe you are mine because i dont think if you not in my life i will have the strength to stand at all, i dont know what the future brings but i know you with me right now, i know we will make it through and i hope you are the one i share my life with, i don't want to look no further because i believe i have found what am looking for in life. i  know am met for you because if am not met for you why does my heart tells me that i am, if there is a way that i can stay in your arms, if i dont need you why am i thinking ofyou, if i dont need you why does you name resound  in my heart, if you are not for me why does this distance made me laugh because distance dont matter what matters is the heart, if you are not for me why do i dream of you as my wife, i know we are far apart but i know this love is true  and i believe we make it through i and hope you are the one i sharemy life with and i wish you could be the one i die with i love you all my life and i pray that you are the one i build my home with. if is wrong or right though i cant be with you tonight know that my heart is by your side.  
Love Always

>   Never in my wildest dreams did I ever believe this would ever happen. I never expected to fall so deeply in love so fast. It all started today with your first email to me.I was scared at first, but again my heart spoke for me. I decided to take a chance and see what would happen, I never thought you miss me or think of me. Now don't get me wrong I believe in love at first sight, but I thought I would be the last person to be bitten by that bug. When you surprised me with a emails, I received a confirmation that had been in my heart since - that I need you. it gave me a little tingle in the pit of my stomach. Something I had never felt
before.
>When i got your email the first time I knew you were real and not a dream that I had hoped to come true. Even though we live apart right now, I have faith that in due time this will all come to an end and we will be together forever. Like the saying goes, "Distance makes the heart grow fonder." Well, my heart has always and will continue to be quite fond of you. i dont want you to be afriad because i will never hurt you provided you do same to me.my love i hope to hear from u soon

To celebrate good times with you and support each other through the bad times. Love is a journey that we will grow together
through. We will learn things about each other every day. We will not always have good times but we will always love each other and work through our problems. i'll Love u forever.

>  Thank you for the comfortable
conversations and for asking me to be yours. Most importantly, thank you for sharing your love and wanting to make me your man. No matter how slowly or at what distance our courtship developes, I know standing before God and our future family, vowing to be your partner for life, was the easiest decision I could have ever made.Each day that passes makes our love for each other grow stronger. Although I know it’s hard for us to be apart, I know there is nothing that can keep us apart forever. Our desires will continue to stretch across any distance, over every mountain and ocean between us. Nothing can stand between us, and nothing will stop me from meeting you.You are my future and nothing can ever keep us from our destiny. I miss you more every day. I am here with open arms where you will some day finally arrive... right where you belong.

>Dear Sunshine
>   In life, we receive a wonderful opportunity, and that is to love. Love comes in many forms. You love people in different ways and for different reasons, depending upon how they have touched your life. Love is a very powerful word and can describe a multitude of feelings, but its main context carries the same meaning.
>I want to tell you that the love I have for you is undying. It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together. I want to lay next to you at night and fall asleep in your arms, only to wake to your beautiful smile. I want to share in your
joys and sorrows. I want to be your everything. You are everything to me.
> 
>You are everything I do. You see and bring out the best in me. You are the one I want to share everything with my thoughts, hopes and dreams. Thinking of you makes my heart feel full. You are such a source of inspiration for me. I will forever be indebted to you for all you have brought to my life. So, to repay you, I promise you my heart and all the love in it for the rest of my life....

>My Dearest , I met you few weeks ago on the Internet, and since that time, I have grown to love you so deeply. I have heard it said that online romances don't last, but I disagree. I know that what we are doing may be considered wrong by some, but I also know what I feel in my heart, and I know that it's real.
>I lay awake at night, sometimes, and I cry 'cause I miss you so much.  and I know that we can't predict the future, but my heart does not lie ... I am so in love with you.
>life can be cruel but when it all comes together there is no moment as sweet. That is how I feel about you entering my life. You have rekindled the
flame called love in me. You have given one more reason to look forward to tomorrow. Now, you are a significant part of my life and I look forward to the day when we can make it permanent. I love you so much. I love you for your kindness, for your caring and giving nature, for your beauty - both inner and outer, and most of all I love you because you are you. The fact that you show me who you really are and not what you think I may want. Sweetie, let this letter be a testament to my true feelings for you. The whole world can see and know how I feel for you. I love you,

>I have never in my life met someone more beautiful, enjoyable, loving, and comforting as you. Since the very
first day that you smiled at me I knew there was something very special about you. I had no idea then that I would fall in love, but now that I have, I am so grateful. I am grateful for us to have wandered into one another's world so softly and unexpectedly. Nature took its course on our hearts and joined them in a way never imaginable.
>I want you to know, that from the very depths of my heart, I love you. And I love everything that creates you, from your hair - that I wish I could play in more often... to your forehead - that I wish I could kiss while you sleep; from your eyes - that sparkle when you smile (just for me)... to your nose - that I wish I could rub my nose against; from your lips - that I just know were made perfectly to fit against mine... to your chin - that I would love to place my finger under to pull you close for a kiss; down your neck and to your heart - that in my own, I claim as mine, and down past every inch of every part of
your existence.
>I wish more than anything that you and I could grow together, love together, learn together, and laugh together, forever. I sincerely feel that between the two of us, we have the kind of love that some people never get a chance to experience. I promise to love you as much as I can, as best as I can, and for as long as I can. And no matter what, it's very important to me for you to know that you are an irreplaceable spirit that will always be a part of me.

The best thing that I can do is to show you now. I liked you so much, Sweetie. You are the best thing that ever
happened to me. You are like the best poetry ever composed, the best song ever played, the best picture ever painted. I never thought that someone like me could get so lucky!

>I'm glad that I can count on you to be there when I need someone to understand, to encourage, to reassure me and I hope you realize you can always count on me too. We share so much of our lives, but it's nice to know that we can still
go our own ways now and then and somehow, the more we grow as individuals, the closer we become.
>I'm so satisfied with all we have together, and I'm sure that those feelings will last ... that I'll cherish you through a lifetime of beautiful tomorrows.
