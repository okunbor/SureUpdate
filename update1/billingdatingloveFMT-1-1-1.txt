I was just thinking about u i really hope we were right in each other's arms kissing and caressing each other cos it just feels right babe to hold u and to want to make sweet love to you baby...You really make me hard always....I was just imagining we could be in a closed door together and there we can just watch a romantic movie and also cuddle while we watch and there and then i start kissing u slowly and cuddling and trying to undress u slowly baby .....As i remove ur bra i kiss ur tits slowly and suck ur nipples very softly and then i grab them and squeeze them softly babe.....And then i take off ur pants and then i place my tongue into ur cunt and then i start sucking ur clit until it becomes so slimy and then i try to insert my dick into u slowly making u moan for more baby and then u hold me so tight and close and then u put ur legs around me screaming for more baby....These would be the words u would say when i am making passionate love to you baby...Fuck me harder baby....pls baby i need you baby....pls hit it harder baby....And then i am so into u i tell u to turn around and hit u from the back while i got u kneeling on the bed with ur ass facing me...And then i start hitting u faster and deeper and u continue shouting for more baby...Saying babe pls i need you more f**k me harder plsssssssssssss.....I really cant wait to make love to you baby...I love you...

===================================================================================
ROMANTIC DATE

 ..and then there would also be a bottle of champagne and when we are done with that we can watch a movie and also listen to slow music and then when we are watching a movie i would just kiss u on ur head to tell u how grateful i am to have u in my presence and then we can both have a bubble bath together and then we can do some naughty things to each other  lol....
 
My idea of a perfect evening out would start with a picnic on a very secluded bluff overlooking the ocean. Dinner would consist of a variety of finger foods that we could feed to each other as sit closely together and watch the waves roll in. After we would eat, we would watch the sun set, wrapped in each others arms. Snuggling, we would then talk about whatever we felt like talking about or just enjoy the warmth of each other's arms as the stars one by one would fill the night sky. The radio would be playing softly, of course tuned into a love songs only station. When our favorite song would start to play on the radio, we would dance slowly under the stars, holding each other tightly. Letting the words of the song speak to each other's heart, we would begin to give into our passion. And then under the stars, with the sound of the gentle waves caressing the shore, we would ... well, being a romantic yourself, I'm sure that you can figure out what would happen next all on your own...lol
If you had an extra hour in your day, what would you do with it?
===================================================================================
DEVOTED!!!
Baby, I'm forever devoted to our relationship together. You are with every touch everything I have ever wanted. Each and every day I sit and wonder just how all of this came about. We were just carrying on with our lives when all of a sudden it happened; i fell helplessly in love with you... I still remember the first day i saw that beautiful smile of yours... its so hard to forget easily , I knew right then that there was certainly something special about you, what I didn't completely know yet was that you are the woman who would turn my world inside out. Yes i mean it cos you brought so much joy to my heart... it was so full of sorrow and sadness and u came just like a wind and blew it all away....  I can't wait until we are able to spend each and every moment together.
Thank you for making all of my dreams come true. I love you because you are the only person who can make me smile and your words touch my heart more than u know...  I love you because in your eyes I see a woman who will Love me more than anyone no matter what. I love you because you will do anything to keep me safe without even thinking twice. I love you most of all because you are my one and only, my soul mate. We belong together, Baby, and I couldn't be any happier. I love you with every breath I take, and every beat of my heart. And that will never change....
Love Richard....

2ND FORMAT!!!!
Hi
Thanks for writing me back and am glad we're getting to communicate right now, Firstly i would love to say that am expressive and i dont keep things to myself, always honest about who i am and i dont mind if anyone judge me by that.Honestly When i first saw your Profile I was intrigued! also with a polite profile, You're a beautiful woman and i really admire that very much.
let me bore you with a little details about me. Am david mckee, 49years old and am widower for almost 2 years now, i have a 2 daughters jade and alice, they are 14yrs and 12years old. i'm Self Employed civil engineer. i'm a very passionate and fun loving person.  Am looking for a serious relationship, someone who wants to settle down i want someone who will love me for who i am, a honest and faithful woman, very loving and caring. She doesnt have to be perfect but she has to be very serious and know what she wants, No games, No dramas and i hope you're looking for the same thing too.
I love to go bowling, fishing, reading a good book, going to football games, watching movies at home or at the movies theater and i like listening to music, preferably r and b, I would say I like the outdoors, like hiking, camping, fishing, and I love the summer time.well i got to stop right here cos i wouldnt want to give u an headache reading all of this now.
Hope to hear from u again.

3RD FORMAT!!!!
 
Thanks for sharing so much about you with me... i'm looking for a woman who is understanding, caring, loving, and a woman who will be there for me. Someone who is willing to give. In some relationships only one person gives, but this is not what I want. A relationship must take both people working together, and loving each other, doing what ever it takes to make things work. communication is very important to me. And I want someone who like to do the simple things, such as a walk in the park, hand in hand, spending alot of time together, getting to know about each other.Honesty is very important and sincereity.
I am a pretty easy going guy. It take alot to get me angry. I want that in a woman as well. Like I said in my profile. It is all about communication and communication is not just talking but also being able to listen. Not just hear the person but listen and absorb and understand what the person is conveying to you.I love individualism. Don't become what you think I will like, be yourself and let me like you! With this as a foundation all the trust and honesty falls into place. It becomes a given and not something you have to look for or ask for. So now i really have to ask... Are u that special woman? Hope to hear from you again.Until then stay sweet and safe and keep smiling.
 
4TH FORMAT!!!!!!

 I consider myself to be very simple. I believe that men needs to be treated with respect and as a equal partner in a relationship, but all I seem to find is the ones that does not know how to respond to that or is untrusting to it. I feel like u should treat somebody with respect and like they are a person not a peice of meat or whatever. I am the type of person who wants somebody to feel wanted not just as a trophy. I am a very affectionate person and I love to cuddle, I like to show somebody how I feel not just telling them. I love to be close to somebody whether it is in the bed on the couch or wherever..
i'm very relationship oriented and I believe life is too short to waste. When I am in a relationship I am committed, honest, and loyal. I think that falling in love is always a good thing, even if it doesn't work out. There is always something to learn from being with someone, and happy times and memories should be cherished. I am looking forward to getting to know you better. I guess I will go for now and hope to hear from you soon.
 
5TH FORMAT!!!!!
I dont know what to say or where to start from sweetheart... You never cease to amaze me with your words and feelings... U've met a very loving and caring man who definitely knows how to treat his woman with love and respect, i do want to be happy finally having someone i know truely cares for me and not afraid to tell how she feels... I feel great and i would say at this point i'm so lucky to have you in my life.... We both want the same things out of life cos i do want to settle down and have a family of my own, . I do want to wake up to kiss my lovely wife and make breakfast for her or simply go to her place of work and or suprise her with flowers to bring smiles to her face. I want that so much and i know we can both make it work well together....
I do want to be your best friend and lover, at the same time be the man who is ready to share your sadness and happiness, who is ready to share his love with you forever.... we are being so connected together even though we havent seen each other... This is more than just looking into each others eyes, its pouring our hearts together, putting our feelings into words, i definitely cant wait to hear your voice.....

6TH FORMAT!!!!

I really appreciate all what u have said and i also think that u are so beautiful and also gorgeous and i am a man who is very down to earth and i think u have really touched my soft spot ... I want to let you know that since we started talking to each other.i do think about you and always looking forward to hear from you... And i just ask myself if this is really happening to me cos i feel so new and i just want to make things go well between us cos you have opened up a part of my heart that will not let you go.  You are so special to me and I can only pray that you feel the same way.  I know that once we are together we can start building a stronger foundation for what we now share.  I want us to grow and learn from one another and always keep God first.  If we do that then I know  He will bless us and our relationship. Am not saying all of this to make u believe its what u neeeded to hear but i truly mean every words...I am looking for that lifetime love that lasts always and I want to share that with you.  I believe that we can make this work because our feelings are already strong and we have yet to meet face to face.  I am a very giving person and I plan to give you my all if you prove deserving of it and I feel that you are.  So baby let's take this thing to the next level and prove to everyone that TRUE LOVE is not dead.  I will do my best to make you happy and support you in everything you do.  I want to be your best friend, your lover,  and the one you trust with your deepest secrets.i will always bring smiles to your face and be there for you always....
Hugs and Kisses
 
 
Good Morning Baby,
I hope everything is ok and i just had to use this opportunity to write you and let u know i miss talking to you so much and i was hoping u would call but i understand u must have been very busy to write or call me...  am always happy when we get to chat cos i feel so new and i enjoy every bit of our chat... I feel secured talking to you and sharing my life with you and baby pls do not be afraid to tell me how u feel about me or if u're not interested in me at all. I always feel something different about u when we get to chat and always excited having someone like u in my life and am not doing anything to mess it up at all. Ok... i would love to be that special man u desire in your life, that man who will share his heart with you, show u so much love and happiness and never do anything to hurt your heart... always there when u need him, sharing your happiness and sadness, that man who is not afraid to look into your eyes and tell you how much he loves you so much.... That man who is always going to be there to hold your hands and kissing you softly showing everyone how much love he has for you... I want to be that SPECIAL MAN in your Life ....
I believe that partners are 100% equal in a relationship and both should be able to feel they can trust each other 100% at all times. I feel that any man who ever disrespects a woman is not a man at all. I am affectionate also and I have no trouble showing it for the right woman in public or private. I love to cuddle while watching a good movie, when were in bed, I love to hug and kiss my woman at anytime and anywhere it could be a store,mall or just on a sidewalk. it takes time and a lot of good effort to form a good relationship. I want a woman to be my best friend at all times, my sweetheart, love of my life, my partner and my soul mate all wrapped up into one lovely woman. I would be all of that for her and more, I would love her with all of my heart and have nothing but good feelings for her.
She should be a very caring person, with a lot of good feelings, be honest, reliable, pleasant personality and have a sense of humor.  I am trying not to ramble here for you but I am looking for the "One". What does that mean to me? She is the person that you can't wait until She comes home from work so you can kiss her and sit down and relax in front of the TV or go out and spend an evening together. The person that just calls to see how your day is going but knows that it just got much better because you are talking to each other. She gives you a lift when you are down and can always make you laugh because you know each other so well. The person that can simply lay in bed with my head on her chest and our legs interlocked for hours and talk about what's on your mind. She is your best friend, your lover, your everything...I'm not afraid to go for it and this is what I want from life because we both deserve the best. I am opening up to you and letting u know my heart because i would love to have a woman like you in my heart... i trust you're not the type of woman that hurt someones heart even though i havent seen you in person, i believe u're a different woman and one in a million.. This is almost a page long already. I feel that we have broken the ice and have found some very common grounds between us and also i dont want you thinking am too good to be true cos this is me and what i really am... Sweetdreams baby and have a good start to your weekend.
 
Hi Dear
I got your message and it was really nice and i want to use these opportunity to let u know that i am really happy and very excited that we are writing each other but i wont be more happier if we chat more and get to know each other better cos i really feel connected to you already and i really want to know why an angel like u is really still being lonely cos i also want to know a lot more about you.I really want someone to treat me right and also treat me like a king and i would do the same and also treat u more like a queen..I am looking for the one who i will cherish and adore and call mine.. Hope u had a beautiful nite rest..
 
 

Hi Baby...
 
I know you're still sleeping now and i just got the chance to read your email to me and i loved hearing your sweet voice last nite... couldnt stop thinking about you and i had to pick up the phone to call you and i thought u knew it was me at first... lol... I totally understand a lot has happened in your past and how much u've been hurt... Baby i would really wish for u to share those past with me and know this isnt about your past anymore... i want u to know every man is not the same and they never truly deserved a woman like you for u to be hurt cos i know u're a woman full of love, affection and kindness and am still wondering why anyone would hurt you... But i came to realise the same thing has happened to me... i give all my heart to someone i truly love and it gets broken in the end... i finally said to myself i would never settle for less of what i want.... i will do everything i can to fight for your heart and let u know am here to love you completely and i would never do anything to break your heart... i would never do that to anyone cos i've been through the same thing baby and i just want u to see through my heart... i really do deserve someone as special as u in my life and i know u will never do anything to break it...
 
it seems you are the right woman which i have been searching for to bring back the smile and happiness...For a good relationship to grow we need to trust each other and be honest with each other to acheive what we want to acheive well i am seeking for woman which will be the flesh to my flesh and also the bone to my bone,It's true I have never seen you and we have never met,Never shaken Hands or even truly hugged and yet! I know for sure you care for me by the kindness that you give.And our keyboards keep us together doesn't matter where we live. So I am emailing you to put a smile on your face and to let you know in my heart you have a special place.The sun is always shining just above the cloudy haze,as we share friendship across an online maze.We express love and kindness without a face.It comes from deep inside our hearts from a special  place. Within our lives we share special dreams, unusual and unique,and it is with our keyboards that we speak. You are a true friend of mine from the emails we exchange and everytime i get to talk to you but i do want it to be more than that baby.. i want to be your best friend, your lover, your man that u love deeply... i really do want u to know how i feel about u from the bottom of my heart....
You have brightened my life with the thoughtfulness you show.Your words encourage me more than you could know.As people change and times keep changing too, one thing stays the same, the way I feel for you and that will never change and i hope to make it more better and fight for your heart and make u trust your feelings for me and know i will never do anything to you hurt your heart sweetheart.... Sleepwell baby and hope we get to talk later on today... Muaaahhhh..
 
Good morning Baby,
 
I am sitting here somewhere in the world thinking about you, thinking about all the things we've spoken about, all the things we've said to each other, thinking about the so many "I Love You's" that have never lost their value even though we've said them more than a million times to one another. I know you are somewhere at the other side of the world thinking about me too. Wherever you are and go, you go with me. I walk by your side. When you go to bed, I am stepping in it at the same time you are. When you sit down to eat, I am next to you to eat too. When you are combing your hair, I am there kissing and stroking it, smelling the smell of the shampoo you use. I am so in love with you - and I can even feel you here ... behind me, touching me, saying, "Love, come with me." I would come with you without hesitation.
Baby, all I am saying now is that I am so happy to have found you. You mean everything to me. You are my earth, my water, my sun. You are everything that maintains life, everything that gives life. Having you with me is like being reborn. Before you, I was dead. I was a zombie wandering around with no destination, or a robot that people commanded. I didn't have a life. Now I have you, and all I want to do is be with you and feel ALL of you. Know that you are wanted ... how much? That is not something I can describe in words - eternally much, horribly, awefully much? I can't wait until I can embrace you, kiss you, to melt with you, to show you HOW much you are wanted. We will be together soon ... I know, a look in your beautiful eyes ... Oh God! I just love You!
Forever and Always,

My idea of a perfect evening out would start with a picnic on a very secluded bluff overlooking the ocean. Dinner would consist of a variety of finger foods that we could feed to each other as sit closely together and watch the waves roll in. After we would eat, we would watch the sun set, wrapped in each others arms. Snuggling, we would then talk about whatever we felt like talking about or just enjoy the warmth of each other's arms as the stars one by one would fill the night sky. The radio would be playing softly, of course tuned into a love songs only station. When our favorite song would start to play on the radio, we would dance slowly under the stars, holding each other tightly. Letting the words of the song speak to each other's heart, we would begin to give into our passion. And then under the stars, with the sound of the gentle waves caressing the shore, we would ... well, being a romantic yourself, I'm sure that you can figure out what would happen next all on your own...lol
If you had an extra hour in your day, what would you do with it?

DEVOTED!!!
Baby, I'm forever devoted to our relationship together. You are with every touch everything I have ever wanted. Each and every day I sit and wonder just how all of this came about. We were just carrying on with our lives when all of a sudden it happened; i fell helplessly in love with you... I still remember the first day i saw that beautiful smile of yours... its so hard to forget easily , I knew right then that there was certainly something special about you, what I didn't completely know yet was that you are the woman who would turn my world inside out. Yes i mean it cos you brought so much joy to my heart... it was so full of sorrow and sadness and u came just like a wind and blew it all away....  I can't wait until we are able to spend each and every moment together.
Thank you for making all of my dreams come true. I love you because you are the only person who can make me smile and your words touch my heart more than u know...  I love you because in your eyes I see a woman who will Love me more than anyone no matter what. I love you because you will do anything to keep me safe without even thinking twice. I love you most of all because you are my one and only, my soul mate. We belong together, Baby, and I couldn't be any happier. I love you with every breath I take, and every beat of my heart. And that will never change....
Love Richard....

Nice to read back from you it seems you are a cool lady and know what you need.so what would you like us to do for fun on weekends? tell me what you want from that site and the kind of man you are looking to find.


Nice I guess you found one for yourself I'll spoil you well enough if you promise to be straightforward and sincere with me I have enough money to do that anyway, one more thing I want you to promise me you're not going back on that site looking for some other sugar daddy I'm enough to take care of you and do not hesitate to ask me for whatever you think you need me to help you with :)


do you like going to beach and seeing new places? i want to have so much fun with you if you don't mind being my sugar babe. and i will setup direct deposit to you bank account so you would not have to worry about bills and other things you need money for, i m ready to take complete care of the girl who will be loyal, caring, honest and give me good attention.


i travel a lot for my construction business and coming to see you when its time is no problem for me, i just need you to trust me and be trust worthy because there are sometimes i'll need you take care of work for me while i do other things. so where have you been able to visit around the world?

OK babe i just got a message from company's payroll officer and he said application to get you on the payroll is in process, all you need to do is be patient till its pre approved and that will be on the next working day, after that we need to send them some fees to finish process which means youll start get money weekly and enough for you to pay bills and everything you need to get done. How do you feel about that now?


i just want you happy always since you're ready to give me complete attention and care.


so babe when the first deposit get available on your account you'll have to send it to engineer immediately for them to finish final process of construction and payroll officer can approve your weekly allowance. Once in a while when get too busy with meetings and paperwork you be the one to get my contract advance payments and you'll help me distribute it to engineers as directed by me
