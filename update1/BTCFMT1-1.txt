   All you need to do is to get a luno bitcoin wallet, when you create your luno bitcoin wallet and your luno wallet identification number and reference number is available then you'll deposit your starting capital into your luno wallet. Then you either go for the long term or short term investment
. The longterm lasts for 5 months with the starting capital of R15,000 and you make 150% profit. While the short term lasts for 1 month with the stating capital of R5,000 and you make 100% profit  and you can either leave your profit in your luno wallet or transfer it in to your bank account successful trade you'll get your profit then you can withdraw your profits from your luno wallet  into your bank account. Luno is more like a bank account because you're the only one who has access to it.
