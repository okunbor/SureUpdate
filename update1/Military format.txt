======================================

I love a woman who can display her affections for me anytime and anywhere without having to be shy. And a woman who knows how to be affectionate is a big plus. I love being affectionate. This may be an odd one, but I've learned that there are many woman out there that are set in their ways. They have one way of doing things and are never open to suggestions or advices. Stubborn woman are a major turn off for me. I like a woman who is open to ideas, thoughts, and basically open minded. I think being receptive brings about sensitivity as well. A woman who is ignorant, mean, and just plain insensitive is difficult to get along with. I would say that I'm not afraid to display my emotions. I'd like someone who is sensitive and caring. If I'm sad, I'd like for her to be able to comfort me and cheer me up. she doesn't has to do much, but just knowing that she's there solacing me is more than good enough. Have you ever had someone not stand up for you? I was deeply hurt when someone I once knew wouldn't not stand up for me, even after she told me she loved me. I would never allow someone to hurt my girlfriend or my wife, and I would always stand up for her. One thing I will always do for my woman is to protect her. I would like to meet someone who will be protective of me. i like listening to R&B slows or sometimes Rap. by then and i will also like to meet you though. Now,i think you've known much about me and i too already known much about you i think ?
