I am into Military..  and ...thats what am into..i entered the army through the R.O.T.C BUT took some more practical training at pentagon..WA in the united state..........................i have started my career on it about  18years Ago and its really my dream and i seek a woman who will surport my dream..........................................

One thing about you women is, many of you pretend to be who you are not, just to get a lady up to you wherever you are and use her up to satisfy your sexual needs and later drop her. I hope you are different but how can I be sure that I will be safe while with you and will not be maltreated as just a sex slave.  How can I trust you on this?
i hope you are for real and that this is not all about internet fantasy just to wipe your time or to satisfy a horny mood because i am for real and seriously looking for a lifetime soulmate.And as i am new to this internet relationship,i would not like to fall a victim.


As future husband and wife, I believe there should be a kind of physical intimacy between us cos I don't really believe much in this online thing as I am new to it unlike being together and really see how we feel about each other. So I will like us to make an arrangement to meet physically so as to make this relationship real and everlasting,what do you think?

 
I want you to realize one fact that in no occasion will I lie about my personality, what would I gain in such? I wish I could open my heart for you to see so that you can be sure I am for real. I don't know what else to say than to tell you that I will always be myself, honest, faithful, caring, loving and affectionate, I do hope you would believe me, lets give love a chance to win and I pray that we will never regret we do so.
.
One thing I understand about nature is that life itself is a risk, we don't have power over tomorrow, we can only try to make tomorrow a better day by trying our best and leaving the rest. I am ready to risk anything, even my very self, to secure my happiness. There are stages in ones life when one needs to take chances to make sure things are right. i believe a try will convince you.    

   Am looking for a woman that will be able to listen to me , communicate his feelings to me , make me laugh, hold and comfort me in need,stand by my side, respect me, passionate lover in every way, support me in everyway, love me and only me, make me smile, protect me when needed, romantic time to time ,constantlyreative, and treat me right.... I know you will think what is a pretty lady like me doing on here .. Yes the reason I came on to the internet to find the special person who deserves all the love and passion that makes up my heart and soul is because I do not have the time to meet others out in a public setting, and the fact I feel you can learn so much about someone through letters, as a person has to take there time and think about the words they want to express, so it allows you to gain a better understanding of someone than you would probably otherwise .we have alot in common
 

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????


l am on here to make my future fufilled,am not really good on internet,but my believe is with a good hearted and God fearing woman like you i will get use to it..my hobbies are swimming.watching war movies and listening to music.....So hun i will love to know more about you  too.?  
Getting back to the Camp  soon..to complete my dream and career......it has really been a dream come true for me to become a real Officer and i have commited all my time and all i have into this career and i hope it leads to a very great future for me............................................................
